The results of their study, published in Scientific Reports, demonstrate that entropy can actually decrease in quantum systems.\n\nLesovik explains, \"We have discovered Maxwell's demon, a mythical creature invented by British physicist James Clerk Maxwell, which can reduce entropy in a system. This contradicts the laws of physics, as a system's orderliness cannot naturally grow in an isolated system.\"\n\nIn the 1870s, Ludwig Boltzmann formulated the principle of growth of entropy in his H-theorem, stating that the value of entropy in a closed system can only increase or remain constant. However, this theorem could not be proven within traditional statistical physics. It wasn't until scientists explored the quantum world that they began to suggest that the H-theorem was rooted in quantum mechanics.\n\nLesovik's team successfully formulated the H-theorem in the language of quantum physics and tirelessly searched for proof. Finally, they uncovered conditions under which the second law of thermodynamics can be locally breached. This breakthrough applies to quantum systems of relatively small but macroscopic size, measuring a few centimeters or even meters.\n\nOne notable difference between classical and quantum approaches is that, in classical physics, the decrease of entropy is connected to the transmission of heat energy. In the quantum world, however, entropy reduction can occur without energy transfer, thanks to quantum entanglement.\n\nExcitingly, Lesovik and his team plan to conduct experiments in the near future to verify this effect. If successful, these experiments could pave the way for the development of new types of quantum coolers and power generators, revolutionizing the field.\n\nThis discovery challenges our very understanding of thermodynamics and opens up a world of possibilities for future research and technological advancements."}, {"article": "Alastair Cook, the former England cricket captain, has stated that playing under a new captain will not be an issue for him following his resignation on Monday.

The law, which has been published on Russia's official legal website, amends Article 116 of the Russian Criminal Code by excluding physical assaults on relatives from criminal charges for first-time offenses.\n\nPreviously, in June 2016, first-time battery was considered an administrative offense unless the violence was motivated by hooliganism, political, ethnic, or ideological enmity, or if it involved assault on relatives. This decision caused uproar in society and led to protests against the criminalization of first-time domestic violence.\n\nAccording to Russian MP Yelena Mizulina, there are already 59 articles in place that enforce criminal responsibility for violence, making it unnecessary to categorize domestic battery as a criminal offense. She explained that the law is intended to address family disputes with minor consequences, which do not require a medical report or result in injuries.\n\nUnder the new law, first-time battery will be punishable by an arrest for ten to fifteen days, a fine ranging from 5,000 to 30,000 rubles (approximately $85 - 500), or compulsory community service for 60-120 hours. However, individuals who commit repeated assaults will still face criminal charges, with potential penalties involving a fine of up to 40,000 rubles (approximately $670), compulsory community service for up to six months, or an arrest for up to three months.\n\nThis change in legislation has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the protection of victims of domestic violence in Russia. Critics argue that it sends a message that violence within families is acceptable or trivializes its impact. Others believe that the new law fails to sufficiently address the issue and protect vulnerable individuals.\n\nAs the law takes effect, it remains to be seen how it will impact the rates of domestic violence and how the Russian government will respond to the ongoing discussions and criticisms surrounding this controversial decision."}, {"article": "Moscow Seeks to Cooperate with Afghanistan in Security\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed Russia's desire to collaborate with Kabul in various areas, particularly in security and the economy.

In an interview with TASS, Timonin emphasized Russia's concerns regarding the decision to deploy US THAAD missile systems in South Korea. While the US claims that these missile systems are purely defensive measures against potential attacks from North Korea, Russia sees the deployment as an attempt by Washington to create a new segment of its global missile defense near the Russian border. Timonin believes that this move undermines Russia's missile potential and directly threatens the country's security. \nRegardless of South Korea's sovereignty in determining its national security measures, Timonin argues that the deployment of THAAD batteries in the country goes beyond the task of deterring a potential North Korean threat and may upset the strategic balance in the region of Northeast Asia. He emphasizes Russia's preference for a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the nuclear problem in the Korean Peninsula and calls for a collective search for a new, constructive strategy. \nThe schedule of high-level contacts between Russia and South Korea in 2017 is currently under consideration, largely dependent on the political situation in South Korea. Timonin expresses contentment with the active political dialogue between the two countries and hopes for its continued engagement this year. He highlights the significance of various past meetings and visits between officials from both nations and the potential for greater bilateral economic ties through the implementation of large-scale investment projects in Siberia and the Far East. Timonin suggests that the creation of new production facilities and the involvement of Korean business in Russia's advanced development territories can promote the expansion of economic relations. \nIn conclusion, Timonin warns that the deployment of THAAD in South Korea jeopardizes the security of Russia and calls for peaceful resolutions in the region.

However, the club released a statement confirming their solidarity with their manager, stating that \"the entire club is and will remain united behind its manager.\"\n\nRanieri addressed the situation by stating, \"This is not a crisis. When you aren't winning, you lose confidence, it is normal.\" Currently occupying the 16th spot, Leicester City is yet to secure a league victory in 2017.

The statement from the club emphasized that their success in recent seasons has been built on stability, unity, and a determination to overcome challenges.\n\nRanieri, who defied all odds last season by guiding Leicester City to the Premier League title as 5,000-1 underdogs, is currently at risk of becoming the first defending champion to be relegated since 1938. The team has only managed to win five league games so far this season.\n\nThere were reports suggesting that Ranieri had lost the support of his players, fueled by rumors of squad tensions over his tinkering and alleged banning of chicken burgers.

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the Trump administration is seeking ways to destroy the military and diplomatic alliance between Russia and Iran in order to end the Syrian conflict faster and intensify the fight against ISIS.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan aims to address the economic crisis and rampant terrorism in order to gain support from the Turkish population. Turkish security forces have arrested nearly 800 individuals suspected of having links to ISIS. This shift in Turkey's stance towards ISIS is attributed to the fact that militants have carried out terrorist attacks against Turkish officials, prompting Erdogan to take action.

Reviving a once-silent brand is no easy task, but Ettedgui is determined to make it work.\n\nConnolly has a rich history, known for its exceptional leather that was favored by luxury car brands, politicians, and even adorned Concorde supersonic planes. Actress Joan Collins once quipped, \"You haven't lived until you have sat your naked butt on Connolly leather.\" The company's legacy and reputation provide a strong foundation for its revival.\n\nEttedgui's connection with Connolly dates back several decades when she first became involved with the brand. She saw immense potential in expanding Connolly beyond leather briefcases into the world of fashion.

For Barack Obama, the answer was a five-star Caribbean holiday - and a seemingly endless grin. The former commander in chief has been pictured beaming on a beach in a backwards cap, flanked by an equally cheery Michelle. The venue for this masterclass in chilling? Necker island in the British Virgin Islands, owned by British billionaire Sir Richard Branson. \n\nSir Richard posted pictures on his blog of Mr Obama learning to kite-surf, and engaging in a play-fight with the businessman. The airline mogul said he invited the Obamas \"for a complete break\" on his private island after they left the White House. Not every president wants a sunshine stay after the West Wing doors swing shut, however.\n\nSo which leaders picked elephant hunting, marrying a relative, and a sideline in oil painting...?\n\nWhen the 43rd president left office in January 2009, he ditched Washington for a quiet life between a house in Dallas, Texas, and his 1,500-acre Prairie Chapel Ranch. Keen to enjoy his retirement, the sexagenarian took weekly painting lessons. His subjects included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Tony Blair, and the Dalai Lama - as well as his pets. His inspiration was his great hero Sir Winston Churchill, who turned to art in his forties as a refuge from the tumult of politics.\n\nDespite being nicknamed 'Teddy' and famously refusing to shoot a bear, the 26th president took a year-long African hunting trip with his son, Kermit, in 1909. The duo were accompanied by more than 200 porters, and scientists from the Smithsonian Institution. They made their way round Africa dispatching over 11,000 animals - including elephants, rhinos, hippos, snakes, zebra, and monkeys among others - before shipping the carcasses home for scientific study. Another exotic trip followed for Mr Roosevelt (and Kermit) in late 1913, when they joined Brazil's most famous explorer Candido Rondon to chart the course of the River of Doubt. The 760km (472 mile) stretch was ultimately renamed Roosevelt River in his honor.\n\nThe aforementioned Teddy Roosevelt had no time for Benjamin Harrison, president from 1889-93, branding him \"a cold-blooded, narrow-minded, prejudiced, obstinate, timid old psalm-singing Indianapolis politician\". But none of that stopped the 23rd president from wedding a woman 25 years his junior, who also happened to be his niece by marriage. Mr Harrison's first wife, Caroline, had died of tuberculosis in 1892. When he wed Mary Dimmick four years later, his two adult children refused to attend the ceremony.\n\nAmerica's first president lived only two years after leaving the job - and spent them making whiskey. In 1799, the year of his death, his distillery in Mount Vernon, Virginia, produced nearly 11,000 gallons - making it the largest in the US at the time.

The average salary offered is 60,000 rubles a month, with programmers and mining engineers earning significantly higher salaries.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in the Arctic regions is the lack of a balanced system for training and forecasting future demand for professions. The Murmansk region is currently testing a standard for human resources in industrial growth, which involves employers, universities, authorities, and the WorldSkills movement. This standard helps forecast demand, develop focused training, and organize independent evaluation and additional education for children.\n\nIn addition to training specialists, the Arctic regions are also focused on supporting the indigenous peoples. For example, the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District is training nomadic teachers for schools and kindergartens in the tundra. Yakutia ensures that big companies in the region employ locals first.\n\nCompanies working on Arctic projects, such as Norilsk Nickel, Rosneft, and Gazprom, are also initiating educational programs. However, currently only five percent of educational programs are implemented in cooperation with employers, according to experts.\n\nUniversities are also contributing to the development of the Arctic. The Tyumen Oil and Gas University has a department of the Earth's cryology, which educates specialists in studying natural processes in cold regions. The North (Arctic) Federal University has an Arctic innovation center to implement research results and has opened 24 small innovative companies. There is also a growing trend of cooperation between Arctic universities and educational institutions in countries such as Norway, Finland, Sweden, Canada, and the U.S.\n\nOverall, the development of the Arctic has created a demand for qualified specialists and has led to the implementation of various initiatives to train and support these professionals."}, {"article": "Title: Plymouth GP Practice Successfully Reduces Waiting Times\nSubtitle: Beacon Medical Group Implements New Strategies to Improve Access to Care\nA GP practice in Plymouth has effectively decreased the time it takes for patients to receive routine appointments with a doctor, reducing the waiting period from three-to-four weeks to under seven days. The Beacon Medical Group, which caters to over 30,000 patients, was established in 2014 after three practices merged. Dr. Jonathan Cope, GP and managing partner at Plympton Health Centre, one of the Beacon practices with 10 doctors, revealed that there are currently 30 unfilled GP positions in Plymouth. Suffering from a shortage of GPs three years ago, the practice decided to explore alternative approaches to working.\n\nTheir solution involved the utilization of clinical pharmacists, paramedic practitioners, and nurse practitioners. By reallocating resources and converting the budget, the practice was able to create the equivalent of two-and-a-half full-time positions. Patients registered at Plympton who require same-day care from their family doctor contact the reception team. Depending on the nature of their problem, they are then called back by an advanced paramedic, pharmacist, nurse practitioner, or a doctor.\n\nDr. Cope explained that due to the additional capacity provided by the non-GP healthcare professionals, GPs' time is freed up, resulting in more appointments for routine problems and shorter waiting times for patients. Simon Robinson, the advanced paramedic practitioner, attends to any emergency medical issues that arise in the practice and conducts an average of four home visits per day. He noted that he often deals with complex cases and is able to spend more time with patients compared to GPs. In case he encounters any queries, he can easily consult the GPs.\n\nWhile acknowledging the value and trust placed in paramedics, Prof. Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, emphasized the unique skill set possessed by GPs, which includes consideration of physical, psychological, and social factors. She expressed concerns about transferring workload pressures from one area of the health service to another and emphasized the shortage of GPs in the NHS.\n\nTo gain insight into the challenges faced by the Beacon Medical Group, an analysis of the 100 most frequent attendees was conducted. Dr. Cope anticipated that the list would primarily comprise frail, elderly patients, but instead, it revealed that the typical patient was a 37-year-old woman with mental health issues, multiple prescriptions, and referrals to hospital. Starting in March, a psychiatrist will hold a weekly clinic at the surgery for these patients and provide additional mental health care training to staff. Additionally, the group aims to offer specialized services that are typically only found in a hospital setting.\n\nThe success of the Beacon Medical Group's approach is evident. Onward referrals to the hospital for dermatology care have decreased by 85%, and musculoskeletal care has seen a 75% reduction in secondary care appointments. This model of providing care to 30,000 to 50,000 patients within a multi-specialty community provider setting is known as a Primary Care Home. Over the past year, there have been 14 other sites adopting this structure across England. The National Association of Primary Care is collaborating with NHS England to explore further expansion of this approach.\n\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) acknowledged the positive trend of professionals working together within GP practices to deliver services. However, they highlighted the urgent need to address the severe shortage of GPs in England, which is adversely affecting patient care and limiting appointment availability to the public.\n\nThis article is part of BBC News' week-long coverage focusing on the state of the NHS across the UK during its busiest time of the year."}, {"article": "Title: Talk, Don't Tech: Managing Your Children's Online Habits\nSubtitle: As parents, many of us find ourselves playing the role of IT manager at home. However, relying solely on technology isn't always enough to keep our kids safe online.\nArticle: Like many parents, I find myself serving as the unofficial IT manager in my household. And, like many IT managers, my users (aka my children) are always dissatisfied with the service they receive. Lately, the complaints have become more frequent as I try to control my teenagers' online time and monitor their internet activities. To accomplish this, I've adopted various technologies, but I'm well aware that there are still loopholes in the system. This is why I resort to \"sneakernet,\" which involves physically interrupting their screen time and redirecting their focus towards more important tasks like homework, chores, or getting ready for school.\n\nAccording to statistics collected by security company Symantec, I'm not alone in using technology to oversee my kids' online activities. Around 44% of parents rely on apps to monitor online usage, 39% check browser histories, and 37% set controls on their routers. I employ all three of these methods and I'm constantly looking for more ways to further enhance my monitoring capabilities. Initially, the advancements in technology seemed promising, with electronics companies offering products equipped with comprehensive parental controls. It's understandable why parents are turning to technology for assistance in managing their children's online time. Nick Shaw, European general manager at security company Norton, explains that it's one area where parents struggle to find effective guidance. He points out that parents might seek advice from their own parents when facing parenting challenges, but this particular issue leaves them feeling clueless. To make matters worse, children are often more technologically savvy, making it easy for them to outsmart their parents. Shaw emphasizes that parents need to recognize their naivety regarding internet usage and have more transparent conversations with their kids. While technology certainly helps, it's essential to engage in dialogue and ensure that children understand the necessity of these controls. Expanding on this point, Tony Anscombe, security evangelist at antivirus company Avast, asserts that open communication about safe internet practices is more effective than imposing strict restrictions. He encourages parents to establish rules for internet usage while simultaneously educating their children on basic security principles. Anscombe claims that many parents overlook this conversation, failing to address what is acceptable and what is not. It's crucial to remind children about the potential risks posed by naivety, including the threat of cyberbullying and unauthorized access to personal information. Additionally, parents should warn their children about the deceptive features within popular apps, which often collect excessive data. Monitoring the apps children use and understanding the information they share is of utmost importance, as some seemingly harmless apps may actually enable secretive behavior.\n\nDr. Sonia Livingstone, an expert from the London School of Economics who specializes in children's internet usage, argues that companies should prioritize designing services that require less protection, rather than focusing solely on selling protective measures. She also promotes the idea of leading by example and encouraging children to make responsible decisions, rather than dictating rules. It's about fostering respect and understanding the benefits of these guidelines, which increases the likelihood of compliance. Ultimately, Dr. Livingstone believes in promoting children\u2019s rights and minimizing excessive control from parents.\n\nAs parents, it's important to remember that while technology does play a crucial role in monitoring our children's online habits, it's equally essential to engage in open conversations with them. By explaining the reasoning behind the controls and educating them about online safety, we can create a safer and more responsible digital environment for our children."}, {"article": "Title: Owning a Home by the Age of 25: How Some Young People Are Making it Happen\n\nOwning a home by the age of 25 has become a far-fetched dream for many in the past two decades. According to a recent study, soaring property prices have resulted in just one in five 25-year-olds being able to own a property, compared to nearly half twenty years ago. However, as the government introduces its Housing White Paper, there are a few young individuals who have managed to defy the odds and become homeowners without relying on financial assistance from their families. \n\nIn this article, we highlight the stories of four young couples who purchased their own properties in 2016, shedding light on how they achieved this feat.\n\nMark Hepburn, 23, a debt collector earning \u00a318,500 a year, bought a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Oldham, Greater Manchester for \u00a3125,000. With a deposit of \u00a36,250 (5%) through the Help to Buy mortgage scheme, he and his partner Laura Starkie, 25, an accountant earning \u00a320,000 a year, were able to escape the confines of living with their parents. They prioritized budgeting, tracking every penny, and even made compromises like opting for cheaper brands. Their hard work paid off, and they are now proud homeowners, urging others to start saving early.\n\nRuby Willard, 22, a recruitment consultant earning \u00a319,000 a year plus commission, and her partner Sam Bardell, 22, an engineer earning \u00a324,000 a year plus overtime, decided to purchase their own house in Havant, Hampshire, for \u00a3182,200. With a 10% deposit of \u00a318,220 through the Help to Buy Isa, they bypassed the prospect of renting and the thought of wasting money. By living frugally and being mindful of their spending, they managed to save up while still enjoying a nice holiday in Greece.\n\nAndrew Douglas, 23, a social worker earning \u00a331,000 a year, and his partner Kirsty Lamb, 24, a pharmacist earning \u00a335,000 a year, were determined to join the property ladder as soon as possible. Saving between \u00a3400 and \u00a3500 a month each, they bought a two-storey terraced house in Moredun, Edinburgh for \u00a3145,000, with a 15% deposit of \u00a321,750 through the Help to Buy Isa. They chose to prioritize their goal over an extravagant holiday, giving them a head start on securing their future.\n\nRebecca Thompson, 23, an information analyst earning \u00a321,900 a year, and Adam Drinkwater, 25, a bank administrator earning \u00a316,500 a year, found that the rent they were paying for a flat was equivalent to potential mortgage payments. With a \u00a36,300 (5%) deposit through the Help to Buy mortgage scheme and Isa, they purchased a three-bedroom semi-detached house in Irlam, Greater Manchester for \u00a3126,500. Despite some sacrifices, like fewer holidays and less disposable income, they are thrilled to have secured a home where they can establish their careers.\n\nThese success stories show that it is possible for young people to become homeowners with disciplined saving, careful budgeting, and prioritizing their future over immediate gratification. However, the rising property prices and challenges faced by graduates make it increasingly difficult for many young individuals to afford their own homes. The government's Help to Buy schemes have proven to be helpful, but more efforts are needed to ensure that home ownership becomes an attainable goal for first-time buyers.\n\nSource: ONS, Department for Communities and Local Government, Land Registry"}, {"article": "Title: Voices from the NHS Frontline: Challenges and Concerns\nSubtitle: Exploring the Struggles Faced by Healthcare Professionals\n\nAndrew Foster, the chief executive of the highly-regarded Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust, has been witnessing a decline in the hospital's performance recently. In 2016, the hospital dropped from meeting the four-hour A&E target of treating or admitting patients by 95% to 90%, and then to a critical low of 85% in the autumn. The situation further worsened after Christmas, with cubicles in the A&E department overflowing, ambulance staff queueing in corridors, and a backlog of patients unable to be discharged.\n\nThe disastrous turn of events began on Boxing Day, when an outbreak of norovirus forced the closure of three wards and resulted in 75 staff members falling sick. Seven care homes also had to shut down. This caused the hospital's performance to plummet to around 60%, marking the worst three weeks Foster has ever experienced.\n\nWhile the pressure has eased slightly since mid-January, with the hospital's four-hour performance now above 80%, Foster remains deeply concerned. He explains that the hospital is seeing an increasing number of patients coming to A&E who could have been seen by a general practitioner, but discharging patients is becoming more challenging due to cuts in social care and the complexity of patients' needs.\n\nSimon Walsh, a consultant in an A&E department at a major trauma center in London, echoes Foster's concerns. He describes this year as the closest he has ever seen the healthcare system come to breaking point. During the period leading up to Christmas, he faced immense pressure and witnessed patients being stuck for hours on end because of a lack of available beds. At times, the department had over 20 patients in a single night, which paralyzed emergency services.\n\nWhile patients and their families understood the difficulties, Walsh highlights the toll it took on staff morale. Fatigue and exhaustion were common among healthcare professionals, and he questioned whether they would return for their next shifts.\n\nKimberley Gardner, a nurse at a major trauma center in the East Midlands, agrees with the Red Cross's description of the NHS crisis as a humanitarian one. She emphasizes the severity of the situation, recounting a case where a woman had to be brought in by ambulance after vomiting from eating Quality Street chocolates. Gardner believes there is a failure in the system, as technicians rather than trained paramedics often respond to calls and err on the side of caution, bringing patients into hospitals unnecessarily.\n\nJulie Orr, the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, expresses how challenging this winter has been. She points out that the pressure has been relentless, with no breaks between the onslaughts. Despite these difficulties, Orr praises her team's ability to cope remarkably well, even though they must explain to patients why there may be delays in their care.\n\nGrainne Siggins, the director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham, acknowledges the immense effort put forth by staff in both local government and the NHS. However, she mentions that the borough's diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues pose additional challenges. Siggins feels that the system is reaching its tipping point and is uncertain about its sustainability in the future.\n\nDr. Olivia Hum, a GP in Lewes, East Sussex, emphasizes the intensified workload in 2017. GPs are facing increased demand due to overcrowded A&E departments and lengthy waiting lists for hospital services. This has led to patients seeking help from GPs for worsening symptoms and caused many GPs to experience burnout, with some retiring early. Dr. Hum believes the current system is unsustainable and compromises the quality of care and patient safety.\n\nAs the NHS faces intense pressure during its busiest time of the year, it is crucial to recognize and address the challenges highlighted by healthcare professionals from various fields."}, {"article": "Title: NHS Health Check: How the NHS Has Impacted Lives\nSubtitle: Personal Accounts Highlighting the Challenges and Successes of the NHS During Winter 2016-17\n\nThe NHS has faced significant challenges this winter, with increased pressure on accident and emergency units resulting in long patient waits. To shed light on the impact of these challenges, we spoke with individuals who have personally experienced the effects of the NHS during Winter 2016-17.\n\nSue's father experienced a dramatic change in his life after falling out of bed while in a hospital in December 2016. Admitted for a hip operation, Sue was not informed about her father's fall for several days. Devastated, Sue was later told that her father would never walk again and potentially had only six months to live. The trauma of the fall and extended hospital stay took a toll on his mental health, leaving him unable to communicate and exhibiting erratic behavior. Sue expresses her frustration with the lack of information from the hospital and the feeling of a constant uphill battle to get answers. She hopes that her father does not fully comprehend his circumstances, as it seems unlikely that he will return home.\n\nJohn Perrins, an ambulance driver, had a life-changing experience when he suffered a heart attack while driving on the M6 motorway. The pain was so intense that he believed he would never see his wife again. Fortunately, an ambulance arrived within 10 minutes, and paramedics successfully saved his life. John praises the ambulance crew for their exceptional care and dedication. He is eager to find their names and personally express his gratitude. Their actions have given him a second chance at life.\n\nTrevor Dallimore-Wright speaks highly of his local GP and hospital, considering them \"like a family\" due to their consistent and life-saving care for his complex health conditions. Having diabetes and depression, Trevor attributes his stability and well-being to his GP. He commends the hospital staff for their friendliness and patient-centered approach, acknowledging their commitment despite the challenges within the NHS infrastructure. However, he highlights the issue of the NHS not covering the cost of immunotherapy drugs, which he believes are crucial in his treatment.\n\nNikki Alldis, on the other hand, expresses her dissatisfaction with the NHS. Living in London, she has been waiting for a bowel operation for 15 months. The procedure has been scheduled and canceled twice, causing immense frustration and disruption in her life. Nikki had prepared her children and work for each scheduled operation, only to receive last-minute calls informing her that there are no available beds. She is still waiting and hopes that the third time will be lucky.\n\nPaul, who suffers from bipolar disorder, praises the crisis care team he received from the NHS during his suicidal episode in January. Despite feeling low and suicidal, he reached out to the crisis team, who provided 24-hour care and ensured his safety. Paul appreciates the genuine care and support he received from the team, although he highlights the lack of counseling services within NHS mental health care, leading him to seek private counseling.\n\nRichard Taylor shares a heartbreaking account of his mother's undignified death due to poor communication and delays in treatment. After being diagnosed with cancer, his mother was sent home, caught in a loop between three hospitals. Richard eventually had to take her to A&E, where she spent 13 hours on a trolley in a noisy and busy ward. His mother passed away a week later in an undignified manner, starving and dehydrated. Richard acknowledges the compassion of the nursing staff but reveals a lack of support for himself. He emphasizes the strain the NHS is currently under.\n\nThese personal accounts provide a glimpse into the challenges and successes of the NHS during Winter 2016-17. It is crucial to recognize the dedication and hard work of healthcare professionals while also addressing the areas for improvement within the system.
