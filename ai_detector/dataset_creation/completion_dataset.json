Many people here believe that air strikes and shelling have caused most of the damage to their beloved city.\"\n\nThe power of social media has played a key role in mobilizing returning residents to join forces and begin the arduous task of rebuilding Mosul. \"Cleaning campaigns are being organized in many neighborhoods, but with limited resources and overwhelming destruction, their efforts can only accomplish so much,\" Javaid shared.\n\nIn a setback for humanitarian efforts, the United Nations announced on Wednesday the temporary halt of aid operations in the eastern neighborhoods currently under intense fighting.

However, without nationwide access to these scans, Professor Kenny argues that the care provided to mothers and babies remains insufficient and inappropriate.\n\nProfessor Kenny highlighted the distressing cases of babies born outside paediatric surgery centers with undiagnosed cardiac defects. Such babies require immediate ex-utero transfer to Dublin after birth, significantly reducing their chances of survival. In other cases, the absence of ultrasound scans leads to missed opportunities for in utero foetal therapy, resulting in babies dying from potentially treatable conditions.\n\nThe impact of this lack of ultrasound is not just limited to the babies; it also takes a toll on maternal health. Women continue to undergo unnecessary caesarean sections and other interventions for infants who cannot survive.

Douglas emphasized that the 250 pre-1996 staff at the center of the dispute had already rejected the Labour Court's recommendation and that a more comprehensive solution was needed.\n\nIn response, Tesco reiterated its commitment to a constructive dialogue and fair resolution to the changes in pre-1996 terms and conditions. The company highlighted its participation in numerous conciliation conferences and a Labor Court hearing, emphasizing their adherence to the industrial relations process. Tesco further urged Mandate to endorse the Labour Court's recommendation, arguing that it provides the path to resolving the dispute.\n\nHowever, tensions escalated as Mandate officials allegedly told workers that \"they are next,\" prompting Tesco management to accuse the union of spreading falsehoods and causing unnecessary distress among their staff. Adding to their discontent, Tesco expressed deep concern with Mandate's call for shoppers to boycott their stores, insisting that it only further complicates the situation.\n\nAs the talks loom on the horizon, the future remains uncertain. Will Tesco and Mandate find common ground, or will the strike persist, intensifying the struggle between workers' rights and corporate policies? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: the battle for fair treatment and job security rages on in the aisles of Tesco.", "mask": 1400}, {"article": "ASTANA, February 16. /TASS/.

The Islamic State, once a formidable force with a stranglehold over significant areas in Syria, has now been severed from the opposition's ranks. This separation signifies the unwavering resolve of the Syrian armed opposition to pave the way for lasting peace in the region.\n\nAlloush's statement has come at a crucial time, as the opposition delegation arrived in Astana to reinforce the ceasefire agreement that has been delicately negotiated between the Syrian government and various opposition groups. While the journey towards peace has been filled with its fair share of challenges and setbacks, this declaration serves as a glimmer of hope, a glimmer that signifies the possibility of a new era for Syria.\n\nThe consolidation of the ceasefire is of utmost importance to the opposition, who have been tirelessly fighting against the oppression and violence inflicted upon their people.

Trump made it clear that Acosta's previous experience with Senate confirmation was a deciding factor, stating, \"He has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed.\" The President's remark hinted at the difficulties his administration has faced in getting all of their nominees approved. Trump wished Puzder the best and emphasized that he had just spoken with him.\n\nHowever, Acosta himself was not present at the event alongside the President. As the current dean of the Florida International University School of Law, he brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the table. Acosta's previous position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board, a role he was nominated for by former President George W.

This is a significant step towards inclusivity and representation, reflecting America's diverse population.\n\nNBC News was the first to report Acosta as Trump's pick for labor secretary. It is worth noting that Acosta has a notable legal background, having previously clerked for Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. His experience in both academia and the legal system will undoubtedly contribute to his effectiveness in this vital role.\n\nNow, the focus will shift to the Senate confirmation process, as Acosta awaits the examination and approval of his nomination. This nomination holds immense importance, as the labor secretary is responsible for protecting workers' rights, ensuring fair labor practices, and fostering healthy relations between employees and employers.\n\nAs the nation navigates uncertain times, Trump's selection of Acosta showcases his determination to assemble a dynamic and capable team to lead America forward.

Organisers in cities across the US are telling immigrants to miss class, work and not to shop on Thursday. \"A Day Without Immigrants\" actions are planned in cities including Philadelphia, Washington, Boston, Houston, Chicago and New York. The protest, that gained momentum on social media and by word of mouth, comes in response to US President Donald Trump, whose administration has pledged to increase the deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally.\nTrump, notorious for his campaign promise to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, has also blamed high unemployment on immigration. As president, he's even attempted to introduce a temporary ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries entering the US. This controversial stance has sparked outrage and led to the organisation of the upcoming protests.\nEmployers and institutions in some cities were already expressing solidarity on Wednesday with immigrant workers. Organisers in Philadelphia said they expected hundreds of workers and their families to participate. \"Our goal is to highlight the need for Philadelphia to expand policies that stop criminalising communities of colour,\" said Erika Almiron, executive director of Juntos, a nonprofit group that works with the immigrant community.\nThe 'Day Without Immigrants' campaign aims to bring attention to the positive impact that immigrants have on American society, culture, and the economy. It serves as a collective demonstration against the fear-inducing rhetoric and policies targeting immigrants. Immigrants, both documented and undocumented, make valuable contributions to various sectors of society, bolstering the economy, enriching the cultural fabric, and diversifying communities.\nThese protests are not just about skipping work or school for a day. They are about amplifying the voice of immigrants and standing in solidarity with them. The impact of this demonstration will resonate far beyond a single day. It serves as a reminder that immigrants are not just faceless statistics or burdens on the system; they are hardworking individuals who contribute to the vibrant tapestry of America.\nAs the 'Day Without Immigrants' unfolds, employers, institutions, and fellow Americans should take note of the absence and recognize the crucial role immigrants play in their lives. It is an opportunity for reflection, dialogue, and a call to action.

We wouldn't call what happened on the runway this week revolutionary, but we would call it a larger step in the right direction.\n\nFashion Week committed itself to real change this season in several ways. Historically exclusive designers like Michael Kors mixed things up, designer Anniesa Hasibuan held a casting call for immigrant models, body positivity hero Christian Siriano hit another home run for body diversity, and much more occurred as well.\n\nNow that the walks have been walked and the news has been made, it's up to the designers to put their money where their publicity-making mouths are by actually designing for the women who walked in their shows. For now, we're happy to pay tribute to those who got it right this week.\n\n1. Prabal Gurung: Gurung's inclusive show featured plus-size models like Candice Huffine and Marquita Pring right alongside Bella Hadid.

Christian Siriano: Following the lead he made last season, Siriano continued with his commitment to diversity, casting models of different sizes, races, and backgrounds in his show.\n\nThese designers should be commended for their efforts to break the mold and embrace diversity. It's refreshing to see them challenge the traditional standards set by the industry.\n\nFashion Week has always been known for its lack of inclusivity, but with these designers paving the way, we can hope for a more diverse and representative future in the fashion industry.\n\nHowever, the true test lies in whether these designers will continue to design for the women who walked in their shows.

While reaffirming the usefulness of dialogue, Grushko cautioned that continued disinterest from NATO could gradually erode Russia's motivation to engage in these discussions.\n\nAcknowledging that dialogue has already yielded positive outcomes, Grushko cited the agreement reached on flight safety protocols as a prime example.

In a High Court civil action, the jury unanimously found the 28-year-old Blackburn Rovers footballer guilty of assaulting 53-year-old Anthony Bradley. \n\nThe jury deemed that Mr. Bradley was entitled to general damages, aggravated damages, and damages to cover medical expenses totaling 130,000 euros for the injuries he sustained.

While he submitted a defense denying Mr. Bradley's claims, Stokes discharged his legal team just before the trial started. \n\nCounsel for Mr. Bradley, Mr. John O'Donnell SC, who appeared with Conor Bowman SC, described the incident as an \"unprovoked attack\" that was \"nasty and cowardly.\" With this assault, Mr. Bradley suffered both physical and psychological injuries, transforming him into a different person altogether, O'Donnell added. \n\nIt is worth noting that Stokes, who has represented Ireland nine times and has played for prestigious clubs such as Celtic, Hibernian, Sunderland, and now Blackburn, claimed he could not attend the hearing due to his partner's imminent childbirth. Interestingly, the same excuse had been used by Stokes in relation to his absence from criminal proceedings last year. The court had been informed of his reason for nonattendance. \n\nThe ruling signifies a significant blow to Stokes, who now faces not only financial repercussions but also a tarnished reputation.

It begs the question: does the fame and fortune of footballers come at the cost of their moral compass?\n\nAs the football world waits to see how Stokes will respond to this ruling, one thing is certain: this court case has further magnified the importance of responsibility and accountability in sports.

Tony Moreno, who stands accused of hurling his baby off the towering Arrigoni Bridge, passionately argued that he never intended to cause any harm to his precious son, Aaden.\n\nGripped by emotion, Moreno fought back tears as he grasped a doll, using it to demonstrate how he was holding young Aaden moments before the fateful fall occurred. The 90-foot-high bridge that spans the majestic Connecticut River became the backdrop of this grieving father's worst nightmare, marking a horrifying chapter in his life that he now desperately wished he could rewrite.\n\n\"I dropped him,\" Moreno confessed, his voice trembling, the agony of his words filling the Middletown Superior Courtroom. The twenty-three-year-old man further revealed that his actions stemmed not from a sinister desire to harm his child, but from a dark place of despair and anguish. He admitted that he wanted to inflict pain on the boy's mother before ending his own life, signs of a troubled soul scarred by years of depression and suicidal thoughts.\n\nHowever, Moreno's defense attorney, Norman Pattis, contends that this harrowing incident was an unintended accident - a heartbreaking tragedy that should not be mistaken for premeditated malice. Pattis raised the possibility that Aaden may have suffered from an undiagnosed muscle disorder, causing sudden and uncontrollable jerking motions that could potentially explain how the infant slipped from his father's grasp.\n\nThe courtroom held its breath as Moreno recounted his darkest moment, his voice quivering with remorse. Though nobody can bring little Aaden back, this trial seeks to understand the circumstances surrounding his untimely demise and deliver justice accordingly. Moreno faces charges of murder and risk of injury to a child, his plea of not guilty underlining the complexities of this case.\n\nThe community remains gripped by this heartrending story, as residents grapple with the unthinkable tragedy that unfolded on that July day of 2015. As the trial unfolds, we witness the unfolding of a complex legal battle, intertwined with gut-wrenching emotions and profound loss.

The current seasonal influenza vaccine has been found to be 48 percent effective in preventing flu-related medical visits, according to a preliminary report in the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. \n\nIn an effort to determine the vaccine's efficacy, the researchers analyzed data collected between late November and early February from a sample of 3,144 children and adults. Within this group, 1,650 of them had received the flu vaccine. The purpose was to identify who sought medical treatment for flu-like symptoms and investigate the impact of the vaccine in preventing such visits.\n\nThe results were promising. The vaccine demonstrated a 48 percent effectiveness in preventing flu-related medical visits for all age groups. However, it provided slightly better protection for young children between the ages of 6 months to 8 years and older adults between the ages of 50 to 64. To be more specific, the vaccine was found to be 53 percent effective in preventing flu-related medical visits for young children and an impressive 58 percent effective for the older adults. \n\nWhile these numbers are encouraging, it's important to note that the vaccine's effectiveness varied among different age groups. Children aged 9 to 17 years old experienced a lower effectiveness rate at 32 percent. Similarly, the vaccine was less effective for individuals between the ages of 18 to 49, with only a 19 percent success rate. Surprisingly, the vaccine demonstrated a 46 percent effectiveness in individuals over the age of 65.\n\n\"We know that influenza vaccine is a good but not perfect vaccine,\" emphasized Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, during an interview with ABC News. Indeed, vaccines can be a powerful tool in combating the flu, but they are not the ultimate solution. However, considering the ease of accessibility and the significant reduction in flu-related medical visits, obtaining the flu vaccine is a clear choice.\n\nThe study's findings provide a glimmer of hope during this flu season, reminding us that we can take proactive measures to protect ourselves and others from the flu. So, don't sit back and let the flu dictate your life - take action and get vaccinated! Your health and the health of those around you will thank you.

Trump's promise of a new executive order comes just as the Justice Department made a request to the court to temporarily halt proceedings related to the previous order.\n\n\"The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision,\" there President Trump stated with an air of determination. The Justice Department filed a 47-page brief on the same day, in which it conveyed that it does not require a larger panel of judges to rehear their emergency challenge to a lower court's temporary suspension of Trump's executive order on immigration, as a new order is already underway.\n\nIn the extensive brief, the Justice Department extensively criticized the \"seriously flawed\" ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, highlighting that there were misinterpretations regarding constitutional concerns. Regardless of this, the department stated, \"(r)ather than continuing this litigation, the President intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns.\"\n\nThe Justice Department further elaborated that the President's intent is to promptly protect the country, opposed to pursuing prolonged litigation. By rescinding the previous executive order, President Trump aims to establish a clear path for the immediate safeguarding of the nation.\n\nIn the aftermath of a three-judge panel's rejection of the federal judge's temporary suspension on the travel ban, speculation had arisen regarding the Trump administration's next steps. The announcement of a forthcoming executive order has clarified the administration's intentions and set the stage for what may prove to be a contentious battle in the days to come.\n\nAs the nation eagerly awaits the release of the new executive order, it is crucial to keep in mind the impact it may have on countless individuals affected by the travel ban. The revised order is expected to address the concerns raised by the court, ensuring that any future restrictions on immigration will be legally sound and in the best interest of the nation.\n\nWhile the controversy surrounding the immigration order continues to unfold, one thing is certain: President Trump's determination to protect the country will persist, as will the fierce debate on how best to achieve this goal.", "mask": 283}, {"article": "US President Donald Trump has launched a ferocious attack on the media while defending his record during his first weeks in office. Mr Trump appeared in a 76-minute press conference where he told reporters their level of dishonesty was out of control. He cited coverage of his campaign's alleged contacts with Moscow. Critics say his stymied travel ban and the firing of a top adviser point to a White House in chaos. But the president used his speech to tout his fulfilment of campaign promises and said his administration was a \"fine-tuned machine\".\n\nMr Trump, known for his candid demeanor, opened his remarks by mounting a blistering attack on the media for underplaying his achievements after he \"inherited a mess at home and abroad.\" He went on to praise his administration for its \"significant progress,\" pointing to a rising stock market and a crackdown on illegal immigrants as examples of his success. Sporting a playful smirk, the President then asked, \"You guys have been having a great time, right? Rating through the roof? I never knew I was that entertaining!\"\n\nHis news conference at the White House comes after Mr Trump's national security adviser was forced to resign, and his labor secretary withdrew his nomination. These recent events, however, did not deter the President from addressing other matters, such as the allegations of illicit ties to Russia. Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's now-former national security adviser, resigned on Monday after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about discussions he had with Russia's ambassador before his own appointment. The President, however, bluntly denied any knowledge of his campaign staff being in contact with Russian officials during the election, dismissing such claims as \"fake news\" concocted by the media.\n\nAmidst the controversies surrounding his administration, Trump's press conference was laced with an air of defiance. He taunted reporters with a mischievous grin, saying, \"You really thought I couldn't handle this job, huh? Well, let me tell you, folks, my administration is like a fine-tuned machine. A machine that's going to make America great again!\"\n\nWhile critics argue that the chaos within the White House indicates a dysfunctional government, Trump remained undeterred. He confidently detailed the progress he has made, raising eyebrows and causing some to question his grasp on reality. Nonetheless, the President managed to maintain an engaging, if not perplexing, presence throughout the press conference.\n\nAs calls for a wider investigation into Russia's alleged interference in the election grow stronger, Trump's defiant stance leaves many wondering what the future holds for his administration.

Among the most popular inquiries were tweets like, \"hello yes where do I get cheaper than candy bar drugs please\" and \"Is no one going to ask him where he's getting drugs cheaper than candy bars.\" It seems America had suddenly found a new obsession \u2013 tracking down affordable narcotics in pursuit of a sugar-free high.\n\nJokes aside, the president's statement struck a nerve. Americans couldn't help but wonder: where are drugs really cheaper than candy bars? They began speculating on Twitter, using the hashtag #CheapDrugsRUs. \"Seriously, where are drugs cheaper than candy bars, @realDonaldTrump?

So, for anything to be cheaper than a candy bar these days was an enticing prospect. Trump had unknowingly ignited a nationwide search for a new kind of bargain. \"Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars,\" he claimed in a moment that caught the nation's attention.

Experts took to news outlets, explaining that affordability doesn't equate to safety or legality. They emphasized the importance of sticking to legal means and encouraged dialogue about addiction and the drug problem plaguing the nation.\n\nAs the frenzy settled down, it was evident that Trump's sensational comment had sparked a conversation that desperately needed attention. While the existence of cheaper-than-candy-bar drugs may remain a mystery for now, the bigger issue remains about the accessibility, affordability, and consequences of illegal drugs in America.\n\nSo, as we continue our pursuit of knowledge in the digital age, let's not lose sight of the real problem at hand.

It is truly disheartening to contemplate how such preventable circumstances led to the loss of a young life.\n\nBedsores, also known as pressure sores or pressure ulcers, are typically caused by prolonged pressure on the skin, often occurring when individuals are confined to a bed or wheelchair for extended periods. While they may seem like mere inconveniences to some, the reality is that these wounds can deteriorate rapidly if proper care is not provided.\n\nIn Joseph's case, these bedsores, often seen as a red flag for neglect, were allegedly left untreated, festering and becoming infected. As the infection progressed unchecked, it ultimately claimed his life. It is baffling and deeply distressing to think that a situation that could have been addressed with timely medical attention led to such dire consequences.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that caring for an individual with disabilities can be challenging, both emotionally and physically. However, when the responsibility of caregiving falls upon someone, it is imperative that they rise to the occasion and provide the care and attention necessary to maintain their loved one's health and well-being.\n\nWhile we await further details and the legal proceedings, it is vital that we highlight the profound importance of monitoring and addressing any signs of neglect or abuse promptly.

This move comes as NATO allies aim to strengthen their defense capabilities and address the emerging security challenges, particularly the \"Russian factor\".\n\nAt Thursday's signing ceremonies in Belgium's Brussels, defense ministers from France and Germany made a significant announcement. They confirmed the joint purchase of Lockheed Martin C-130J transport planes, ensuring improved transport capabilities for both nations. In another display of unity, Germany, Belgium, and Norway have decided to join a Netherlands-led fleet of Airbus A330 tanker planes.\n\nTo further enhance military coordination and effectiveness, plans are underway to establish a new command center for Dutch, Belgian, and Danish special forces. This center, which may potentially be utilized by other NATO nations as well, will provide valuable operational support and facilitate seamless collaboration. The exact location for this headquarters is yet to be determined, according to a NATO official.\n\nIn addition, Norway and Germany have expressed their intention to acquire a new-class of submarines called U212As. These advanced submarines not only offer enhanced detection capabilities but also possess the ability to effectively track and engage enemy submarines and ships on the water, bolstering NATO's maritime defense posture.\n\nGermany has also taken the lead in joint training and deployments of land forces. Collaborating with the Czech Republic and Romania, Germany aims to form a larger division, with both countries set to contribute a brigade of several thousand troops under German leadership.

However, a spokesperson from the coalition was not immediately available for comment, leaving the situation in a grim state of ambiguity.\n\nAs the community grappled with the immense tragedy, heartbreaking accounts emerged from witnesses. Villagers recounted the harrowing moments when mourners had gathered to offer their condolences after the passing of a woman. Suddenly, the sound of planes filled the air, instigating a flood of panic as people frantically tried to escape the perilous situation. Tragically, the bombs mercilessly struck the house directly, causing the roof to collapse and leaving bloodstains everywhere, as if to permanently etch the sorrow into the very fabric of the village.\n\nAmidst the chaos and destruction, courageous individuals and residents of the village aided in the search and rescue operation.

This tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing conflict and its devastating consequences for the Yemeni people. The need for a peaceful resolution becomes more urgent than ever. As the world grapples with its own challenges, we should not forget the atrocities that continue to unfold in Yemen.\n\nIn the midst of this darkness, we must stand together in solidarity with the people affected by this tragedy, demanding answers and justice for those whose lives were unjustly taken. The Yemeni people deserve peace, security, and the opportunity to mourn their loved ones without fear of further harm.

Sinwar, who spent 23 years in an Israeli prison, is expected to act as a bridge between the political leadership of Hamas and its powerful armed wing, Izzedine al-Qassam. This move is seen as a demonstration of Hamas' democratic institutions and its ability to bring forth new leaders when necessary.\n\nSinwar's rise to power has not been a surprise to those close to Hamas, as he has been seen as a key figure within the organization. Lebanon-based senior Hamas leader Osama Hamdan stated that Sinwar's election demonstrates Hamas' strong leadership and the pool of talented individuals ready to take on important positions. It is hoped that Sinwar, with his security background, can play a vital role in improving relations with Egypt and avoiding further military confrontations with Israel, which have proven costly in the past.\n\nIsraeli journalist Avi Issacharoff draws attention to the fact that Sinwar comes from a different background compared to regular Hamas politicians. Issacharoff highlights Sinwar's past involvement in hunting down and killing \"Palestinian collaborators.\" However, despite this, it is believed that Sinwar will not act recklessly and drag Gaza into an unwanted military conflict with Israel. In fact, the journalist reveals that Sinwar underwent a serious head surgery in 2006 while in prison, indicating that he values his life and understands the consequences of his actions.\n\nIn an interesting twist, Issacharoff mentions that Sinwar was known for making excellent Arabic sweets, particularly kunafa, during his time in prison. This tidbit adds a touch of unexpectedness to Sinwar's story and showcases his diverse abilities beyond his involvement in Hamas.\n\nHamas operates as a system of federations, including Gaza, the West Bank, Hamas prisoners in Israeli jails, and Hamas members abroad or in exile. Each federation elects its own council and leader. These recent elections will eventually lead to the election of Hamas' overall general congress, the General Consultative Council, which will then select the political bureau and its head to replace the current leader, Khaled Mashaal, in April.\n\nThe new leadership of Hamas faces a multitude of challenges ahead, which will impact the likelihood of another war in Gaza. Sinwar's appointment, along with other newly elected leaders, will play a crucial role in steering Hamas' future path and determining the direction of Palestinian resistance. The eyes of both Gazans and the international community will be on them, watching closely to see how these leaders navigate the uncertain times ahead.", "mask": 508}, {"article": "MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/.

No fixed wordings exist so far. In any case, this may only pertain to placement and administration of accounts of state-owned companies, strategic companies, and extra-budgetary funds. No other restrictions are being discussed at the moment,\" Moiseev stated.\n\nThe Finance Ministry's initiative to potentially restrict work with nonresident banks has sparked curiosity and concern among Russian companies and citizens alike. Rumors have been circulating about the extent of these possible limitations, with some fearing a complete halt to financial interactions with foreign banks. However, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev has clarified that any limitations would solely apply to the placement and administration of accounts.\n\nThese potential restrictions, although not yet formalized, would primarily affect state-owned companies, strategic companies, and extra-budgetary funds. The aim is to ensure greater control and oversight of the financial activities of these entities. Transparency and security are key factors that the Ministry is focused on when considering this initiative.\n\nIt is important to note that no other restrictions are currently being discussed. The Ministry's primary objective is to regulate the placement and management of funds, particularly in the case of organizations that play a significant role in the country's economy. This initiative is part of the government's ongoing efforts to strengthen financial stability and prevent any potential risks in the banking sector.\n\nWhile this news may cause some uncertainty initially, it is crucial to remember that these potential limitations are still in the early stages of consideration. The Ministry has not yet finalized any specific details or provided concrete guidelines. Russian companies should continue to monitor the developments closely and stay informed about any official statements or updates from the Finance Ministry.\n\nIn the meantime, businesses are encouraged to maintain open lines of communication with their banking partners and seek guidance from professionals in the field. It is important to remember that these potential restrictions, if enacted, would be targeted towards specific aspects of financial operations rather than a complete ban on working with nonresident banks.\n\nThe Finance Ministry acknowledges the concerns and questions raised by the public and assures that any decisions made will be aimed at ensuring a stable and secure financial environment for all parties involved. As the discussions progress, further information will be released to provide clear guidelines and address any uncertainties.

The machine uses radioactive cobalt-60 to produce gamma rays that halt tumors in organs near the skin. Installed in 1989, it is from a generation of devices that are completely phased out in most developed countries. The machine has broken down many times before. Doctors who are familiar with the technology say such a machine should normally not exceed 20 years' use.\n\nThe Senegalese government promises that three state-of-the-art linear accelerators, which are standard elsewhere, will be installed by August. This is somewhat surprising given that Senegal's hospital system is a reference for the West African sub-region. Patients cross borders to receive diagnoses, treatments, and surgeries. The hospital in Dakar boasts a research unit and some of the only modern DNA sequencing machines on the continent.\n\nThe strength of the country's health system, which doctors are proud to say is more than 100 years old, is due in large part to a long-standing high level of medical education in Senegal. Medical students from Algeria and Morocco come to Dakar for research and studies. Yet the system is fragile and overwhelmed. Almost 14 million people live in Senegal, but only a handful of doctors focus on cancer. Doctors in the developed world recommend one radiation machine or linear accelerator for every 200,000 people. Senegal has one, and this year it is broken. So the lines in the cancer ward are long.\n\nWe were fascinated by this story and wanted to film it. But accessing the primary city hospital with cameras has always been nearly impossible. This time, things looked different, and the small team of cancer doctors appeared to welcome us. We took the opportunity with caution. It seemed this crisis had struck the cancer team personally, and at least several were eager to talk. Behind closed doors and off-camera, some spoke of their anger that such an old and sometimes dangerous machine would still be the standard for the country.\n\n\"We should have linear accelerators,\" they said, shocked that the state had not invested a few million dollars in the new machines. The staff had been trying to raise awareness of the machine's consistent failure since 2015, when it broke down and electrocuted a patient on the table. It also burned others. They were amazed that only now the media seemed to be taking notice.\n\nThey took us in to see the device, to look at the bespoke plastic masks that were made to hold patients still, and to watch as the great old machine head - with radioactive cobalt 60 at its center - swiveled in a wide arc over a cold plastic bed. Interviewing patients, which we had assumed would be the straightforward part of the shoot, was even more difficult.

The actions are intended to illustrate the contributions of immigrants in the United States, particularly Latino immigrants.\n\nFrom the bustling streets of Washington, D.C., to the vibrant neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, Boston, and Philadelphia, down to the lively cities of Austin, Texas, and San Jose, California, all the way to the heartland in Des Moines, Iowa, countless business owners are joining hands in solidarity. Today, the nation will witness a powerful display of unity as hundreds of businesses take part in these protests.\n\nPresident Trump's hardline stance on unauthorized immigrants, his controversial promise to construct a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and his plans for \"extreme vetting\" on immigrants from certain countries have galvanized immigrant communities across the country. This protest is a way for them to raise their collective voice and demonstrate the invaluable role immigrants play in American society.\n\nUnited for Change, a group based in North Carolina that played a key role in organizing today's protests, took to Facebook to convey their message. \"This will be a peaceful day,\" they wrote. The economic impact of this boycott remains uncertain, but initial reports suggest it could disrupt the flow of \"business as usual.\"\n\nErika Almiron, the executive director at Juntos, a Latino immigrant advocacy organization in Philadelphia, passionately explained their intent to ABC News, saying, \"What would happen if all of us were disappeared the way Trump wants us to?\" This poignant question aims to shed light on the immense contributions immigrants make to our daily lives, both seen and unseen.\n\nThe scale of today's movement is difficult to determine at this time, but Almiron mentioned that nearly 100 vendors at Philadelphia's iconic Italian Market have closed their stalls in support.

Notable names in the culinary world, such as celebrity chefs Jose Andres and Andy Shallal, are leading the way, showing their unwavering support for the cause.\n\nThe resonating message behind the Day Without Immigrants protest stands as a testament to the power of unity and solidarity. As business after business closes its doors and restaurants offer a limited taste of what they usually serve, communities will feel the impact of the absence, reminding us all of the indispensable role immigrants play in shaping our nation.\n\nToday, as we witness this nationwide protest, let us reflect on the contributions made by immigrants and recognize the importance of embracing diversity and inclusivity in our society.", "mask": 2050}, {"article": "Title: Moscow vows to continue efforts to ensure jailed pilot Yaroshenko's release\nSubtitle: Russian foreign ministry remains determined to bring justice to imprisoned pilot\nArticle: MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/.

The Russian pilot, who was unlawfully seized in Liberia back in 2010 and transported to the United States, has since faced a series of legal battles and relentless incarceration, much to the chagrin of many supporters and human rights activists. Moscow has voiced its concerns multiple times, citing the clear violation of Yaroshenko's rights and denying his fair trial.\n\nThe continued commitment of the Russian foreign ministry reflects its dedication to rectify this glaring injustice. Ryabkov expressed the government's unwavering determination, strongly affirming, \"We will tirelessly advocate for Yaroshenko's release until justice is served.\"\n\nAs the plight of this wronged pilot captures the attention of the international community, it is increasingly evident that Yaroshenko's cause resonates with humanity's belief in justice and compassion.

And we refuse to be silent any longer.\"\n\nThe ongoing conflict in the Middle East and the involvement of G20 states, particularly in the Syria conflict, took center stage as a main concern for the protesters. Nils Jansen, a member of the Bonn Youth Movement, voiced his frustration, saying, \"On one hand, you have some G20 members supporting different parties and Islamist, so-called rebels, who are in fact militants like al Qaeda and al Nusra. Then on the other, you have Russia, China, and Iran, who are supporting [President Baschar] al Assad's regime.

So, we demand that the G20 get their hands off of Syria.\"\n\nTo emphasize the devastating consequences of Middle Eastern conflicts caused by G20 states, some protesters fell to the ground during a minute's silence, symbolizing the lives lost. \"Warfare over resources and raw materials is the reason why more and more people are becoming refugees,\" one protester passionately stated, while others shouted that G20 policy was \"murderous.\"\n\nThe demonstration also took aim at the rise of right-wing populism, with protest leaders warning against the \"Donald Trumps\" of Europe.

The operation was a resounding success, resulting in the arrest of 18 individuals involved in the terrorist activities of the extremist group. But that's not all; authorities also seized more than $500,000 in cash during the operation, dealing a significant blow to the financial network fueling ISIL's vile objectives.\n\nAmong those who had been covertly aided by the cells was Taye al-Say'ari, one of the two suspected fighters killed in a recent security operation in Riyadh last month.

With a wit matched only by his diplomatic skills, the Russian envoy managed to shed some light on the alleged vulnerabilities of NATO and its strategic approach.\n\nAs he addressed the crowd, Grushko emphasized the vast financial resources that NATO possesses, largely due to the contributions made by its European members. With military spending exceeding even that of superpowers like Russia and China, it becomes clear that NATO's strength lies not in its weakness, but in its collective power.\n\nHowever, the Russian envoy did not shy away from drawing attention to some questionable aspects of NATO's perception of threats. He highlighted the seemingly contradictory nature of continuously proclaiming NATO's superiority, while at the same time fostering a narrative of vulnerability when it comes to Russia.\n\n\"It is curious to observe NATO's propensity to perpetuate the myth of its own weakness in the face of Russia.

Muffled whispers of agreement and murmurs of surprise filled the room as diplomats and military strategists began to question their own preconceived notions.\n\nFollowing the conference, reactions emerged from both within NATO's corridors of power and from experts in political and military circles worldwide.

Others, of course, countered his argument, citing unique challenges facing NATO that call for continued vigilance.\n\nNonetheless, Grushko's words have stirred the pot, sparking a lively debate among experts and policymakers alike. As NATO prepares to discuss its future strategy, these newfound reflections on the alliance's strengths and weaknesses may prove pivotal in shaping its path forward.\n\nRegardless of where one stands on the matter, it is evident that Grushko's pointed remarks have rocked the boat.

The Taoiseach indicated yesterday at his parliamentary party meeting that the leadership issue could be discussed next week but many want it dealt with immediately.\n\nHowever, a request by Minister for Social Protection Leo Varadkar to bring forward the timing of the next parliamentary party meeting was not agreed to. Party Chairman Martin Heydon said a meeting would take place at the usual time in Leinster House next Wednesday.\n\nIt's being viewed as highly significant that the two leading contenders to replace Mr Kenny, Simon Coveney and Mr Varadkar, both addressed the meeting with an almost identical message. It was a simple and direct one: the party needed to be ready for an election from now on. It was taken as a coded warning to the Taoiseach to prepare to depart office, given that he has made it clear he will not lead the party into the next election.\n\nAnd indeed, this coded language was given voice after the meeting by some of those once regarded as the Taoiseach's most loyal supporters. The apparent act of co-operation between Mr Coveney and Mr Varadkar has led some in the party to question if both men have a tacit agreement in place that guarantees the defeated candidate the job of Tnaiste. One way or the other, it has had the effect of quickening those inexorable moves against the Taoiseach should he fail to announce his departure plans.\n\n\"The next few days will tell a lot, but it's looking increasingly likely that this will be wrapped up very quickly.

In the Bundesliga last week, a rotated starting XI featuring Emre Mor, Christian Pulisic, and debutant Dzenis Burnic crashed to a deserved 2-1 defeat.\n\nIn Lisbon on Tuesday, Tuchel had a point when he said his team were unlucky after dominating much of the game and restricting the hosts to a single shot on goal. But while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was guilty of extreme profligacy in front of goal, Benfica took their chance.\n\nThe storm clouds are gathering off the pitch too as Dortmund prepare to face Wolfsburg in front of an empty Sdtribne, having accepted the DFB's punishment for the actions of some fans in the last home game against RB Leipzig. DW will be on hand to see how they cope against a Wolves side who put in an impressive second-half performance to beat Hoffenheim last week. \"If there's ever a good time to play Dortmund, it's probably now,\" said coach Valerien Ismael, ahead of a fixture which also sees former Dortmund hero Jakub Blaszczykowski return to the Westfalenstadion.\n\nAre RB Leipzig still in the title race?\nRB Leipzig wants to recover from two straight defeats. They may be benefitting from some goodwill following the abuse suffered by their fans in Dortmund two weeks ago, but they come into this game on the back of two straight defeats for the first time this season.\n\nLast week's 3-0 home defeat against Hamburg left them seven points behind leaders Bayern Munich, with some suggesting that the title race could already be over. Emil Forsberg and Timo Werner returned to action last week but were stifled by Hamburg's deep defensive line and will be hoping for more success in the Rhineland.\n\nDavid Upamencano could be a doubt after Ralph Hasenhttl dragged the struggling teenage center back out of the firing line last week. The protests against the controversial Red Bull-backed club are set to continue despite the incidents in Dortmund, as fans of other Bundesliga teams express their disapproval.\n\nThe stakes are high for Leipzig, who not only want to reestablish their winning form but also silence their critics. Can they regain their stride and remain in the title race or will they continue to falter? All eyes will be on their performance this Matchday.\n\nStay tuned for an exciting and action-packed Matchday 21 as Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig battle to regain their winning ways amidst swirling controversies and mounting pressure.", "mask": 1500}, {"article": "Title: Russian spies seek a White House source\nSubtitle: nan\nArticle: It's every Russian spy's dream: to recruit a source inside the White House - or any place of power in Washington.

It has gone on for decades, originally with the Cold War goal of placing a mole inside the White House, a retired KGB officer who once ran spy operations in Washington told ABC News.\n\nA senior intelligence official told ABC News last night that no evidence gathered by the FBI so far suggests Trump associates knew they were talking to Russian intelligence officers. Those contacts being scrutinized by the FBI were first reported by The New York Times on Wednesday. \"These are not all sophisticated people, but they should have assumed or considered their Russian contacts might be spy service agents too,\" the official briefed on the investigation said.\n\nRussia has repeatedly denied making contact with Trump aides during the campaign. The Russian Embassy declined requests for an interview this week.

It's a concept Boeri initially built in Milan in 2014.\n\nThe towers will be outfitted with over 1,100 trees and 2,500 plants and shrubs, according to a press release. Boeri's ambitious design hopes to produce not just a visually stunning addition to the city skyline but also a practical solution for combating pollution.\n\nImagine a bustling metropolis where skyscrapers stretch far into the heavens, but instead of concrete and glass, they are adorned with lush, green foliage. The Nanjing Green Towers promise to transform the perception of urban architecture. Dubbed as \"vertical forests,\" these majestic structures offer a glimmer of hope in the battle against smog-choked cities.\n\nAs urban populations continue to swell worldwide, the problem of air pollution becomes an ever-pressing concern. Boeri's vertical forest concept is an elegant response to this challenge. By integrating nature back into the heart of cities, these towers become veritable lungs, breathing life into previously lifeless horizons.\n\nAside from their ecological benefits, the Nanjing Green Towers also aim to inject natural beauty and serenity into the lives of city dwellers. Picture standing among the trees, with leaves rustling in the wind and birds joyfully chirping, all while being located hundreds of meters above the ground. It's a surreal experience that promises to revolutionize the way we envision and interact with our urban environments.\n\nThe Nanjing Green Towers will undoubtedly serve as a global inspiration, showing just how harmonious the coexistence of mankind and nature can be. As we witness the technological advancements the world has made, it's refreshing to see architects like Stefano Boeri channeling their creativity and talent towards the betterment of our planet and our lives.\n\nWhile the Nanjing Green Towers may be the first of their kind in Asia, they certainly won't be the last. Architectural firms worldwide are taking notice and adopting Boeri's visionary approach. Hopefully, this trend will continue to gain traction, leading to a greener and healthier planet for future generations.\n\nIn a world plagued by environmental concerns, the Nanjing Green Towers stand tall as a testament to human innovation and a beacon of hope amidst the smog.

'Terrorist car bomb'\n\nA car packed with explosives has blown up in the south of Baghdad, killing at least 55 people and wounding dozens more. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group claimed responsibility for Thursday's attack, which came amid a renewed wave of violence in the Iraqi capital. \n\nBaghdad was rocked by a wave of deadly suicide bombings during the first days of 2017, but relatively few explosions had been reported since. However, Thursday's car bomb reminds us that the threat is still very real. The security situation in Iraq remains tenuous, with terrorist organizations continuing to carry out these senseless acts of violence. \n\nSecurity sources said the vehicle that blew up was parked in a crowded street full of garages and used car dealers, in Bayaa neighbourhood in the southwest of the city. Iraqi officials said the bomb targeted car dealerships in the mostly Shia neighbourhood. It's a tragic reminder that even those looking to buy or sell a car are not safe from the dangers of terrorism. \n\nThe site of the bombing was an open space used as a second-hand car market where hundreds of private sellers park their vehicles and wait all day to discuss prices with prospective buyers. It's a bustling area that, until today, was filled with the hopeful conversations of car enthusiasts. Now, it is marred by the devastation caused by this vicious attack. \n\nThe Amaq propaganda agency linked to ISIL, which has claimed nearly all such attacks recently, reported the blast and described it as targeting \"a gathering of Shias\". It is heartbreaking to see that once again, innocent civilians are being targeted because of their religious beliefs. \n\n\"A terrorist car bomb attack struck near car dealerships in Bayaa,\" a spokesperson for the Baghdad Operations Command said in a statement. An interior ministry official gave a death toll of 52 and said that more than 50 other people were also wounded. Hospital officials confirmed the figures. \n\nAs the day turned to dusk, security officials could be seen inspecting the site, trying to understand the magnitude of the carnage. Meanwhile, amidst the chaos, some distressed civilians desperately searched for their relatives, hoping to find them safe and unharmed. Others, in a sad reflection of our times, took pictures of the large crater caused by the blast, using their mobile phones to capture the grim reality before them. \n\nThis car bombing is a clear reminder that the threat of terrorism is far from over.

Neither Christie nor his attorney attended the second probable cause hearing two weeks ago or Thursday's hearing.\n\nThe misconduct complaint was filed last fall by William Brennan, a retired firefighter who has mounted a campaign for governor. Last fall, McGeady issued a finding of probable cause, but a higher court sent the case back to him after ruling Christie should have been represented at the initial hearing and Brennan should have been subject to cross-examination.\n\nFor Christie to go on trial, the case would have to be presented to a grand jury, which would have to hand up an indictment. \n\nThursday's development comes as Christie, whose approval ratings have sunk below 20 percent in recent months, has gained traction with the passage of anti-opioid legislation, a cause he has championed.

Supporters of the president will hail his bold stance against what they believe to be a biased media, while critics will argue that he continues to deflect from the crucial issue at hand - the relationship between his administration and Russia.\n\nThe term \"fake news\" has become a popular catchphrase in recent times, with politicians and media outlets often using it to discredit information that doesn't align with their respective narratives. However, the consequences of this continuous finger-pointing are a growing distrust in media, further challenging the public's ability to distinguish between truth and fabrication.\n\nIn an era where information is accessible at the touch of a button, it is vital for citizens to foster critical thinking skills and evaluate news stories from multiple sources to form well-rounded opinions.

The delicate situation was resolved without any harm befalling the courageous lady, a testament to the skill and expertise of the brave Garda officers who fearlessly confronted the offender.\n\nThe details surrounding the hostage situation are still emerging, but the authorities are tirelessly piecing together the puzzle to determine the motive behind this distressing incident. They have not disclosed any information on the relationship between the woman and the captor or what led to this dangerous predicament. One can only hope that the investigation reveals justice and closure for the victim, providing answers to her ordeal.\n\nThough the incident ended on a positive note, it serves as a chilling reminder of the dangers that can lurk within our peaceful neighborhoods.

The statement put them at odds with Trump, who said at a White House meeting with Netanyahu that Middle East peace does not necessarily have to include the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nWhile Trump's comments have stirred controversy and uncertainty, it is important to understand the complex dynamics at play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been vocal about his opposition to both a one-state and two-state solution. This has left the Palestinian people in a state of limbo, unsure of their future and the fate of their homeland.\n\nThe Palestinians have expressed their support for a one-state solution, but with the condition that it is a democratic state, ensuring equal rights for all its inhabitants. They vehemently reject the idea of an apartheid system, where there would be separate and unequal systems for Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nTrump's comments regarding Israeli settlements also raised eyebrows. The US president stated that he thinks the issue is currently meaningless, as the Israelis have already made plans for further settlements in the West Bank. If Trump truly wanted to make a difference, he would have called for a halt to these settlements while his administration gets settled.\n\nIn this evolving landscape, it is reassuring to see the UN and Arab League reaffirm their support for a peaceful resolution through the establishment of a Palestinian state. The two-state solution has long been seen as the most viable option for achieving lasting peace in the region. Palestinian leaders and the international community have consistently advocated for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, believing it to be the path towards a comprehensive and fair settlement.\n\nOn a separate note, the Arab League's Secretary-General, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, issued a warning against the potential relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Trump's administration has expressed serious consideration for this move, which could ignite explosive consequences in the Middle East.

He touted his own poll numbers, victory over Hillary Clinton, and discussed cable TV ratings and panel discussions.\n\n\"I'm here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It's a mess. At home and abroad, a mess.\"\n\nThat was the kind of message \u2013 directed at large numbers of voters disgruntled with the performance of Washington's political establishment and delivered in a plainspoken, unvarnished manner \u2013 that helped Trump win the presidency against all odds. But his manner is also likely to offend or alarm other voters and may do little to alleviate skepticism towards Trump among political elites in Washington.\n\nTrump, in fact, predicted how his animated and unorthodox news conference will be interpreted in the press.\n\n\"Tomorrow, they will say: 'Donald Trump rants and raves at the press,'\" Trump said. \"I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you. You know, you're dishonest people. But, I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it.\"\n\nThe general impression was of a president who is deeply frustrated at the way his new White House is being portrayed and who had decided to take matters into his own hands with a dramatic intervention. The news conference was not scheduled until Thursday morning, but aides said Trump was itching to get out and defend himself.\n\nA senior administration official told CNN's Jeremy Diamond that Trump was eager to directly address the American people, bypassing the media filter which he believes consistently misrepresents his actions and intentions.\n\nOverall, Trump's press conference was unprecedented and likely to dominate headlines for the next few days. Whether you believe he was simply defending himself or going on an egotistical rant, it is undeniable that his unscripted approach is refreshing to many and concerning to others. Only time will tell how his unconventional style will impact the presidency and the country.

And the armed conflict that has been raging in eastern Ukraine for nearly three years has left people on edge, waiting for what could come next.\n\nWith tensions escalating in the region, Lithuania's government has taken proactive steps to ensure the safety of its citizens. Conscription has been reinstated, and young Lithuanian men are being called upon to serve their country and defend it against potential aggression.\n\nAmong those conscripts are Lukas and Jonas, two spirited individuals who embody the determination and resilience of the Lithuanian people. Both in their early twenties, they have decided to put their personal lives on hold to serve their nation in these trying times.\n\n\"It's an honor and a duty to protect our homeland,\" Lukas says with a determined look on his face. \"We train day in and day out to ensure that we're ready to defend our country if the need arises.\"\n\nTheir basic training takes place in a military camp in the rural outskirts of Vilnius, the capital city. Here, Lukas and Jonas undergo rigorous physical training and learn essential combat skills. But it's not just about physical readiness; they also receive extensive theoretical knowledge, studying military history and tactics to become well-prepared soldiers.\n\n\"It's challenging, no doubt,\" Jonas admits. \"But we are determined to defend our country and ensure the safety of our loved ones. We understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of being prepared.\"\n\nOutside the training grounds, tensions in the region are palpable. NATO troops have been deployed to the Baltic states as a show of solidarity and a deterrent against potential aggression. Lithuania has also increased its defense budget, investing in modern weaponry and technology to bolster its military capabilities.\n\nThe government has been actively engaging other NATO members, calling for increased joint exercises and cooperation to ensure a unified response to any potential threats. It's not just about defending Lithuania alone; it's about standing together in the face of aggression and protecting the principles of freedom and democracy.\n\nAs Lukas and Jonas continue their training, their determination remains unshaken. They are just two of the many conscripts who have willingly answered the call to arms, ready to defend their homeland against any aggressor.\n\n\"We may be a small country, but we are fierce. Together, we will stand strong and protect what is ours,\" Lukas declares, his voice filled with resolve.\n\nAs tensions continue to escalate in the region, Lithuania remains vigilant, focusing on strengthening its defense capabilities and fortifying its alliances.

The bomber entered the main hall of the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan and detonated his payload amid dozens of worshippers, according to three security officials, who said at least 20 women and nine children were among the dead. \n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters. Fazal Palejo, a senior health official in Sindh province, confirmed the toll. The Islamic State group claimed the attack in a statement circulated by its Aamaq news agency, saying it had targeted a \"Shiite gathering.\" The Sunni extremist group views Shiites as apostates and has targeted Pakistan's Shiite minority in the past. It views Sufi shrines like the one targeted Thursday as a form of idolatry. \n\nRaja Somro, who witnessed the attack, told a local TV network that hundreds of people were performing a spiritual dance known as the Dhamal when the bomber struck. \"I saw bodies everywhere. I saw bodies of women and children,\" he said. Local TV showed graphic footage of the aftermath of the blast, with wounded worshippers crying out for help and the floors covered with shoes, blood, and body parts. Women cried and beat their chests in grief. Ghazanfar Shah, the custodian of the site, said security was lax at the shrine, which is entered through two gold-plated doors.\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed that security forces would track down the perpetrators of the attack and bring them to justice. In a press conference held later in the day, he condemned the act as a senseless act of violence and expressed his deepest condolences to the families of the victims. He assured the nation that the government would not rest until the extremists responsible were held accountable for their actions. \n\nThis tragic incident serves as a grim reminder of the ongoing threat of terrorism that countries like Pakistan continue to face. Communities are left shattered, mourning the loss of innocent lives. It is high time for the international community to come together and collectively combat these extremist groups that pose a threat to global peace and security.\n\nAs Pakistan grieves, it also strengthens its resolve to fight against terrorism. The country has been actively engaging in anti-terror operations and taking steps to enhance security measures. However, incidents such as this highlight the need for continued efforts to dismantle extremist networks, address root causes, and promote tolerance and understanding among different religious groups. \n\nThe world stands with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism, and it is crucial that nations join forces to eliminate the breeding grounds of hatred and extremism.

What was once seen as a fast start for the President has now turned into political turmoil as intractable controversies continue to consume political capital, hindering his ability to enact his agenda.\n\nRepublican Sen. John McCain expressed his concerns, stating, \"As far as national security is concerned, this White House is in disarray.\" He is not alone in his alarm, as Army Gen. Raymond \"Tony\" Thomas warned that \"our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon because we're a nation at war.\" These warnings highlight the growing concerns over the White House's scattered focus and its potential impact on the safety of the American people.\n\nThe Trump campaign's alleged connections to Russia have only added fuel to the fire, especially after the resignation of Trump's former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Questions surrounding the communication between Trump's advisers and Russian operatives during the election continue to plague him, with Trump refusing to address the allegations. However, this silence only intensifies the furor around the issue, making it impossible for him to put the distracting saga to rest.\n\n\"This is a major distraction, even if you are not the President or the vice president\u2014it affects the entire building. It affects the entire national security apparatus,\" said Mark Lowenthal, a former CIA assistant director of Central Intelligence for Analysis and Production. The constant swirl of controversy makes it challenging for the administration to focus on their work and the priorities that should take precedence.\n\nThe White House also faced another setback when Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination over ethics issues. Each day seems to bring new controversy and conflicting messages, overshadowing any successes that Trump may have achieved thus far. This includes his well-received Supreme Court pick and his hosting of several foreign leaders, which aimed to reassure America's allies.\n\nIn just three-and-a-half weeks, the Trump administration has generated a year's worth of negative headlines due to internal tensions and controversies. Critics argue that these distractions detract from the important work of the presidency.\n\nVice President Mike Pence has also faced criticism, as he reportedly only learned about Flynn's misleading actions from news reports, despite defending him on television earlier. While Pence's reputation may have been affected, there are conflicting reports about his focus on the issue. It is undeniable, however, that Pence plays a crucial role as a steadying influence within a relatively inexperienced West Wing team.\n\nAnother destabilizing factor in the administration is Trump himself. His impulsive and mercurial nature amplifies controversies with his Twitter activity, and he often appears obsessed with his own political fortunes. This behavior has raised concerns among some Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who warned that Trump's approval ratings would be higher if he stayed on message.\n\nThe White House continues to be mired in controversy and struggles to find stability. Trump's signature style may have thrived during his campaign, but in the White House, it is becoming increasingly clear that chaos has become the new norm.

He emphasized the urgent need for transparency and accountability in the handling of such monumental projects, especially those dedicated to the healthcare of our nation's children.\n\nWith the staggering cost-to-benefit ratio and the ever-increasing price tag, the Public Accounts Committee has rightly intervened to ensure that taxpayers' money is being appropriately allocated. The meeting will offer an opportunity for the board members to clarify how exactly the costs have skyrocketed before a sod has even been turned.\n\nWith a project of this magnitude, there is no room for ambiguity.

She said DUP \"arrogance, contempt and serious allegations of corruption around the RHI scandal\" had forced next month's snap election.\n\nHowever, Ms. Foster hit back that it was not up to Sinn Fein to decide who should lead her party.

But perhaps even more unsettling is the realization that the American Dream, once seen as a beacon of hope and opportunity for all, is not as attainable as it seems.\n\nThe Land of Dreams, as it is often referred to, has become a battleground for those seeking a better life. But who gets to define what the American Dream truly is? Is it a one-size-fits-all aspiration, or does it exclude certain groups of people?\n\nIn our quest to uncover the reality of exclusion and denial within the construction of the American Dream, we spoke to individuals and experts from various walks of life. Their stories paint a vivid picture of the challenges faced by those who, despite their dreams and aspirations, find themselves constantly sidelined.\n\nElaine Brown, an American prison activist, cuts through the facade with a sobering proclamation: \"Here is this great so-called land of the free, home of the brave, that is denying the most fundamental citizens' rights to a certain group of people.\"\n\nBrown's words resonate deeply in a country that prides itself on its democratic values. Yet, the reality is that certain groups continue to face systemic discrimination that limits their access to the American Dream. From racial minorities to the LGBTQ+ community, many are left grappling with barriers that hinder their pursuit of happiness and success.\n\nOne such barrier is the struggle for affordable housing. As rental prices skyrocket and the cost of homeownership becomes increasingly out of reach, a significant portion of the population finds itself trapped in a perpetual cycle of housing insecurity. This reality is often compounded for marginalized communities, perpetuating an uneven playing field in the pursuit of the American Dream.\n\nMoreover, the education system, often hailed as the great equalizer, reveals its own set of shortcomings. As opportunities for quality education become concentrated in affluent areas, underprivileged communities face a stark disadvantage. This disparity further entrenches the American Dream as an elusive concept, attainable only for those with the means to escape their circumstances.\n\nBut it doesn't end there. The American Dream promised social mobility, the ability for individuals to transcend their socioeconomic status through hard work and determination. However, studies have shown that, compared to other developed countries, upward mobility in the United States is shockingly low. The system that was supposed to provide a ladder to success is leaving many stuck on the lower rungs, unable to ascend.\n\nThis disparity and denial make it clear that we are living in a country divided. The ideals upon which America was built are being challenged, and the consequences are dire. As we explore the construction of the American Dream, it becomes evident that we cannot ignore the stories of exclusion and denial any longer.\n\nIf America truly wants to reclaim its title as the Land of Dreams, it must confront these inequalities head-on. It is time to redefine the American Dream, making it a universal pursuit rather than an exclusive privilege. It is time for the people to come together and demand change, holding those in power accountable for their failures to address the systemic barriers that deny the American Dream to so many.\n\nOnly then can we hope to bridge the gap between the idealized vision of America and the harsh reality faced by many of its citizens. Only then can we truly embody the spirit of the land of the free and home of the brave.", "mask": 1075}, {"article": "Why the Women's March on Washington Broke Google\n\nBy Margaret Gardiner\n\nThe Women's March on Washington broke Google.

At this point, more than 200,000 women are expected to turn up.\n\nAlong with the many statements of excitement at participating in a march to highlight unity and diversity, there is also slight nervousness. On the Official Facebook page, some are expressing wariness at potential clashes with Trump supporters, but the overall consensus seems to be that this will be a peaceful demonstration. The march's focus is about including the excluded, and those voices are coming together in a powerful statement.\n\nInflammatory remarks about minorities by the incoming President have created an anti-PC climate. Given that many feel that dissension doesn't lead to discussion but frames one as an enemy resulting in mocking, threats, and labels used to control and limit, the stance seems to be that it's important to conduct oneself with decorum.

You may have become desensitized to your own feelings, not necessarily the extremes like anger or elation, but the subtle ones \u2013 what you like, what you want, or even what brings you joy.\n\nIf you feel like you don't really know what you want on a daily basis and make decisions solely to avoid the pain of indecision, it's a clear sign that you are desensitized to your own body. But fear not, there's a way to re-sensitize yourself and unlock the clues hidden within.\n\nStart or revisit a hobby that involves connecting with your senses and allows for self-expression. It could be painting, dancing, cooking, gardening, or playing a musical instrument. Engaging in such activities creates a bridge between your body and mind, helping you reconnect with your own desires and rediscover the joy of dreaming.\n\nRemember, dreams are not solely reserved for childhood fantasies but serve as guiding lights throughout our lives. So, if you are among those who have never had a dream or have lost touch with that inner creativity, take the necessary steps to heal or re-sensitize yourself. Let your dreams unfold, for they hold the power to shape your future and ignite the spark within you.\n\nTime and therapy can work wonders, but it's up to you to take the first step towards reclaiming your dreams.", "mask": 1076}, {"article": "Title: The Ongoing Battle Against Police Brutality in France\n\nSubtitle: Tensions rise as the French Court of Justice investigates an alleged sexual assault by a police officer on a young black man named Theo\n\nFor more than a week, France has been rocked by tensions that flared up over a police officer allegedly sexually assaulting a 22-year-old black man named Theo with a truncheon in the Parisian suburb of Aulnay-Sous-Bois. This brutal aggression is the latest police violation to dominate headlines in French mainstream media and to trigger protests against police brutality.\n\nTheo was on his way to visit a friend when the police stopped him to check his ID. A video of Theo's violent arrest by the police circulated on the internet, showing him forced down against a wall and beaten by four policemen. In his account to the media, Theo explained how he fell face down as police spat racist insults and sodomized him with a police baton during the brutal arrest. The French police called the violent assault \"an accident.\" Theo was subsequently treated in the hospital.\n\nHis case triggered protests in several Parisian suburbs, which at times turned into riots. Protesters and the police clashed, notably in the suburban town of Bobigny, where cars and buses were burned, and stores were ransacked.\n\nAt this stage, the French Court of Justice is looking into how to assess the nature of the assault against Theo and whether it should be considered rape or an act of violence. This determination, according to the court, can only be established by understanding the perpetrator's intention at the time of the incident. The French Penal Code reserves a harsh punishment for rape. Article 222-23 of the law states that, \"Any act of sexual penetration, whatever its nature, committed against another person, through violence, constraint, threat or surprise, is a rape. Rape is punishable by 15 years of imprisonment.\"\n\nOn February 20, a judge is expected to decide whether the accused policemen will face trial. A conviction of rape and a jail sentence for the policeman could be considered by Theo's family a victory and satisfy people's demands for justice. However, if the policeman is acquitted, a repeat of the 2005 riots triggered by the deaths of two teenagers during a police chase is highly probable.\n\nAs the incident took place amid a heated electoral campaign, it was not surprising to see presidential candidates capitalizing on it to make quick gains. Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate, voiced support for the police forces and their \"right to defend themselves.\" Le Pen refused to condemn the assault on Theo, thus using this horrible abuse to attract voters and stir up racial tensions in suburban neighborhoods.\n\nLe Pen's opportunism is reminiscent of the actions of former President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2005 when he was the interior minister and a presidential candidate. Sarkozy came out in support of the police forces during the riots in Paris suburbs. Two years later, in 2007, Sarkozy was elected president of the republic.\n\nThe French police continue to justify its abuses with the lack of human and material resources, as if respecting individuals' human dignity is somehow associated with material resources and/or the number of policemen on the ground! - The assault on Theo is just another case of abuse of power by the French police against civilians that has become a norm in the past few decades.\n\nSuch incidents serve as a reminder of the tense relationship between the police and the inhabitants of the suburbs. The regular riots and confrontations that follow every police assault highlight the urgent need for change and reform in the French policing system. Until then, the battle against police brutality in France marches on, with Theo's case representing a pivotal moment in the fight for justice and accountability.", "mask": 143}, {"article": "Official expects BBC documentary on Russian football hooligans to be nothing but fiction\n\nMOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/.

The most notorious altercations erupted between Russian and English fans ahead of the June 11th match. Brawls began on June 9 in Marseille, peaking on the day of the match - June 12. Law enforcement authorities resorted to tear gas, smoke pellets and water cannons to disperse the brawlers. According to reports, more than 30 people had been injured in violent altercations, with four people sent to hospitals after sustaining severe injuries. On June 14, French policemen stopped a bus with over 43 Russian football fans en-route from Marseille to Lille, where their national team played its second group stage match against Slovakia.\n\nRussia is currently in full-swing preparations for the global football tournaments after the country clinched the bid, following the final vote at the FIFA Executive Committee in December 2010. The victory came following a tight race against the bids from England, Portugal and Spain, in addition to a joint bid on behalf of Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nThe country selected 11 host cities to be the venues for the matches of the 2018 World Cup and they are Moscow, St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan, Saransk, Kaliningrad, Volgograd, Rostov-on-Don, Nizhny Novgorod, Yekaterinburg and Samara.

The world has changed radically since the last meeting in the Hotel Bayrischer Hof just one year ago. From Brexit to \"fake news\" and the election of Donald Trump as US president, the cooperation between Europe and the United States is on tenuous ground. Potential trade wars loom on the horizon. US cooperation with NATO is being fundamentally questioned. Trump has declared the North Atlantic military alliance \"obsolete\" in its current form, rocking the very foundations of the community of Western values. And Trump's unclear policy with regard to Russia is fueling primordial fears in many European countries.\n\nAs a result of this insecurity, the conference halls in Munich will be packed. Wolfgang Ischinger, a German diplomat with decades of experience and the main organizer of the three-day event, said in Berlin on Monday that he had never seen such a rush to register. \"There have never been as many question marks around foreign policy issues as there are today,\" he explained.\n\nConference hopes to provide clarity on US policy\n\nWolfgang Ischinger 47 foreign ministers, 30 defense ministers and 90 parliamentarians are due to attend. The presidents of Ukraine and Poland are already there, as is the new Secretary General of the UN, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Policy, and the NATO General Secretary. \"The only ones we didn't invite were the North Koreans,\" said Ischinger. \"We weren't bold enough for that.\"\n\nAll eyes are on the American government delegation, which includes Vice-President Mike Pence. Pence is making his foreign policy debut in Munich with a keenly anticipated keynote speech. Ischinger predicts that the queue outside Pence's conference room will be correspondingly long. In addition to Pence, the US Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, is supposed to attend. The US Congress will be represented by, among others, Senator John McCain. McCain, a Republican, is one of the fiercest critics of the first steps taken by the Trump administration.\n\nWolfgang Ischinger anticipates that America will commit to NATO in principle, but that this is sure to be part of a harsh stance that will demand more financial and military commitment from the Europeans.\n\n'Post-Truth, Post-West, Post-Order?'\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and a number of German ministers are, of course, also taking part. Merkel's speech is keenly anticipated as a counterweight to Trump's doctrine of \"America first.\" All around the world Merkel is repeatedly cited as a steadfast politician who champions open and liberal democracy. But with the revival of nationalist movements all over Europe, this political model is being strongly questioned.\n\nLong-time allies are now forced to reevaluate the role of Europe in the global landscape. Is Europe still the beacon of stability it once was? Can it maintain its values in the face of rising nationalism and global uncertainty? These are the questions that will be discussed and debated at the Munich Security Conference.\n\nAs the anticipation builds, all eyes will be on Munich, where politicians, diplomats, and experts will come together to stress the value of Europe and find a way forward in this turbulent political climate.

DW has obtained several documents revealing Turkish activities in Germany and European states.\n\nGerman police on Wednesday raided the homes of four imams alleged to have spied on the opposition for the Turkish government. The police action is part of an investigation into what documents obtained by DW show to be a broader Turkish effort to collect information across Europe on supporters of the religious movement Ankara blames for last July's failed coup attempt.\n\nThe raids targeted the homes of four Turkish imams affiliated with the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB), Germany's largest Islamic umbrella group with over 900 mosques tied to the Turkish government's Directorate of Religion, or Diyanet.\n\nThe Federal Prosecutors Office (GBA) said in a statement no arrests were made in the raids in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) and Rhineland-Pfalz, which aimed to collect evidence into imams conducting alleged espionage against supporters of the US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara blames for last July's failed coup attempt.\n\nThe prosecutor's office said the reason for the raids was related to a September order from Diyanet, a religious body tied to the Turkish prime ministry, for imams to pass information to diplomatic missions on Gulen supporters.\n\nThe Cologne-based DITIB is under pressure to severe ties with Ankara. According to the documents obtained by DW, 13 imams and a \"deputy coordinator\" in the two states provided information to the Turkish religious attach\u00e9 at the consulate in Cologne on at least 14 Gulen affiliated institutions and 45 people with alleged ties to the Gulen movement.\n\nNRW's ministry of education has identified five people on the list as state-employed teachers. A NRW interior ministry spokesman confirmed the documents from the Turkish consulate obtained by DW were the same as those in their possession. \"It cannot be ruled out that further reports were drawn up from Germany and the neighboring countries,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to naming people, the consular memos speak generally of those who \"provide support or are sympathizers\" of the Gulen movement, report no activity, or name former institutions in their region.\n\nGerman authorities have contacted those named on the lists and advised them against travel to Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has engaged in a massive post-coup purge. Several of the imams have returned to Turkey, DW learned after making calls to some of the mosques, a factor likely to complicate the federal investigation.\n\nMost of the Gulen-affiliated institutions are engaged in after-school tutoring for the socio-economically disadvantaged, inter-religious dialogue, cultural activities, and projects to better integrate Turks in Germany. In NRW alone, the movement runs 63 associations and five private schools that get partial state support.\n\nIn the wake of the coup attempt, Turkey has called on all countries to clamp down on the Gulen movement, which it considers a terrorist organization. The issue has raised tensions between Turkey and some of its NATO allies, including Germany.\n\nOn Thursday, Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag condemned the raids and accused Berlin of acting indirectly under the influence of the Gulen movement. He said the investigation into the alleged spying showed how easily Germany \"believes the allegations of terrorists.\"\n\nOsman Esen, who heads the Gulen movement's operations in NRW, told DW that since the coup attempt monetary support for the group has dried up and attendance at its educational institutions has fallen.

His back-and-forth with reporters touched on everything from his critique of the media to his Electoral College margin of victory, the workings of his administration, former national security adviser Michael Flynn's resignation, and more.\n\nTrump's news conference was nothing short of memorable, filled with his trademark outspokenness and colorful statements. Here are some of the most unforgettable lines from the event:\n\n1. On how things are going: \"This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine.\" Trump left no room for doubt about his confidence in his administration's efficiency, painting a vivid picture of streamlined productivity.\n\n2. On leaks and news: \"The leaks are real, the news is fake.\" Trump addressed a contentious topic, highlighting the contradiction between factual leaks and what he claims as fake news. Undoubtedly, this statement sparked heated discussions in newsrooms around the country.\n\n3. On picking his next question: \"I want to find a friendly reporter.\" Trump's humor was on full display as he mocked the media's perception of him only giving favorable treatment to friendly reporters. He playfully embraced his reputation and added an element of entertainment to the event.\n\n4. On false claims about his Electoral College win's spot in history: \"I was given that information, I don't know.\" Trump's candid admission led to some eyebrows raising, challenging the accuracy of his electoral victory claims. This moment showcased the human side of the president, acknowledging that mistakes can happen even at the highest level of leadership.\n\n5. On his own speech: \"I'm not ranting and raving, I'm just telling you you're dishonest people.\" Trump's penchant for calling out what he perceives as dishonesty in the media was evident in this remark. Despite the fiery tone, the president managed to inject a touch of humor into his critique.\n\n6. On Obamacare: \"Obamacare, they fill up our alleys with people you wonder how they got there.\" Trump's unique way of phrasing his dissatisfaction with Obamacare left the audience imagining crowded alleys filled with mysterious individuals. It was a memorable way of painting a rather vivid picture of the consequences he believes the legislation brings.\n\n7. On reports about Russia contacts: \"You can talk all you want about Russia \u2014 which was all a fabricated fake news... It is all fake news. It is all fake news.\" Trump's repeated emphasis on allegations of fake news regarding Russia undoubtedly caught listeners' attention. He conveyed frustration with the media's focus on the topic, asserting his belief that it lacked factual basis.\n\n8. On Flynn: \"I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right.\" Trump's defense of Michael Flynn sparked controversy, cozying up to his former national security adviser despite the concerns that led to Flynn's resignation. This statement showed Trump's loyalty and refusal to openly criticize his allies.\n\n9. On why Flynn was fired: \"The thing is he didn't tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he\u2026\" The incomplete sentence added an element of suspense to the news conference, leaving journalists and listeners eagerly anticipating what would come next. It was a strategic move that kept the attention firmly fixed on the issue at hand.\n\nPresident Trump's news conference was a whirlwind of memorable moments, capturing the attention of both supporters and critics alike. His remarks ranged from assertive and defensive to humorous and provocative, making it an event that won't easily be forgotten.

That's how the G20 meeting of leading and developing economies could best be described. And there was one man among the foreign ministers gathered in Bonn who was very much sought after.\n\nThe likes of Rex Tillerson, Boris Johnson, or Sergey Lavrov did not travel to Bonn, Germany, in order to find the perfect mate. And yet, their schedule came awfully close to looking like a speed dating event. Aides were rushing up and down stairs, and ushering delegates in and out of conference rooms at the World Conference Center in Germany's former capital. Everyone's favorite date was US Secretary of State and former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. All eyes were on the Texas businessman turned politician. It seemed as if delegates from countries as different as South Africa and Saudi Arabia were all hoping that Tillerson would clarify what US foreign policy under President Trump will look like.\n\nAmong the many meetings Tillerson had behind closed doors, one stood out in particular: the encounter he had with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. Remarks by Lavrov suggested that the two men had seen each other before, but it was certainly the first time they shook hands since Tillerson took office. \"The United States will consider working with Russia where we can find areas of practical cooperation that will benefit the American people,\" Tillerson told journalists after the meeting, which had addressed conflicts in Syria, Ukraine, and Afghanistan - not exactly the kind of clarification many had hoped for after weeks of uncertainty over how close the White House and Kremlin would be working together.\n\nWhile trying to establish a good working relationship with Lavrov, Tillerson at the same time had to soothe his European counterparts. They fear that the Trump administration is getting too close to Moscow, moving away from Western partners and alliances that have existed for the last seven decades. Tillerson did his best to relieve these doubts, declaring that \"the United States and Europe have been united for almost 70 years, and we will continue to be united in the face of common challenges.\"\n\nThe G20 meeting in Bonn was undoubtedly a crucial opportunity for world leaders to gauge the new administration's stance on international affairs. With all the uncertainties surrounding President Trump's foreign policy, many countries were seeking reassurance. The meeting resembled a giant speed dating event, with diplomats and delegates scrambling to secure their much-needed clarity.\n\nAs the meeting progressed, Tillerson's every move was closely watched. His meeting with Sergey Lavrov was especially intriguing, as it was their first public interaction since Tillerson assumed his role. The expectations were high, and the outcome left some disappointed. While there were no clear answers about the future of US-Russian relations, Tillerson did emphasize the intention to seek areas of practical cooperation.\n\nConcerns about the United States' alleged shifting focus towards Russia and away from its traditional Western allies were also addressed. Tillerson reassured European counterparts that the enduring relationship and shared values between the United States and Europe would stand strong in the face of common challenges.\n\nOverall, the G20 meeting in Bonn served as a platform for world leaders to search for lost trust in uncertain times. The speed dating analogy was oddly fitting, with delegates seeking clarity and reassurance from the US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. Though the search for the perfect match may continue, the G20 meeting provided some much-needed insight into the future path of US foreign policy.", "mask": 80}, {"article": "Title: The Making and Breaking of Europe\nSubtitle: We analyse how populist far-right movements are challenging the promise of an integrated union.\n\nArticle: Europe is at a crossroads. Populist far-right movements are challenging the very premise of an integrated European Union. To understand Europe and where we are today we have to go back to the Europe that no longer exists. Alina Polyakova, research scholar, perfectly sums it up, \"Anti-immigration rhetoric is coalescing with anti-EU politics to challenge the liberal ideals of the European integrationist project.\"\n\nIn this two-part series, \"The Big Picture,\" we will delve into the intertwined history of the European project and the far right in postwar Europe, exploring both the East and the West. Let's begin our journey by revisiting the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community from the ashes of World War II and unraveling the remarkable trajectory of a united Europe.\n\nThe story starts with the realization that cooperation and unity were essential to prevent another catastrophic war on the continent. Following the devastation of World War II, European leaders vowed never to repeat history, recognizing the need for a new approach to foster peace and prosperity throughout the region. This led to the birth of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951, which aimed to merge the coal and steel industries of six founding nations - Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.\n\nBy pooling these key resources, the founders of the Community aimed to ensure that war, specifically one driven by the military build-up fueled by these industries, would become impossible. Remarkably, this initial step towards integration laid the groundwork for what would eventually become the European Union we know today.\n\nOver the next few decades, the European project steadily evolved, with the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and the establishment of the European Economic Community. The project expanded, welcoming more member states and reaching new heights of collaboration and integration.\n\nHowever, just as Europe evolved, so did the far-right movements. Despite the overwhelming success and the clear benefits that European integration brought, populist far-right movements began to gain traction. Their staunch anti-immigration rhetoric and criticisms of the EU's perceived encroachment on national sovereignty struck a chord with certain segments of the population.\n\nThe rise of these movements is not confined to a specific region; it affects both Eastern and Western Europe. In the East, countries such as Poland and Hungary have seen nationalist movements gaining popularity, challenging the very principles that underpin the European Union. In the West, countries like France, Germany, and the Netherlands have also witnessed the rise of far-right parties, further complicating the European political landscape.\n\nThe populist far-right's appeal lies in their ability to exploit the anxieties and discontent of certain sections of the population. Concerns over immigration, economic inequality, and national identity are effectively weaponized to fuel their anti-EU sentiments. They promise solutions that often resonate with those who feel left behind or marginalized by the forces of globalization.\n\nHowever, as we explore the making and breaking of Europe, it becomes clear that the far-right movements' challenges are not insurmountable. The European Union has faced obstacles and crises throughout its history, yet it has always found a way to adapt and evolve. Perhaps Europe's current predicament is an opportunity for self-reflection and reformation, to address the legitimate concerns of its citizens, while safeguarding the values and principles that have brought peace and progress for over half a century.\n\nIn part two of \"The Big Picture\" series, we will delve deeper into the specific challenges faced by the EU and explore potential solutions to bridge the growing divide.

They have built an Earth-sized \"virtual telescope\" by linking a large array of radio receivers - from the South Pole, to Hawaii, to the Americas and Europe. There is optimism that observations to be conducted during 5-14 April could finally deliver the long-sought prize.\n\nIn the sights of the so-called \"Event Horizon Telescope\" will be the monster black hole at the centre of our galaxy. Although never seen directly, this object, catalogued as Sagittarius A*, has been determined to exist from the way it influences the orbits of nearby stars. These race around a point in space at many thousands of km per second, suggesting the hole likely has a mass of about four million times that of the Sun.\n\nBut as colossal as that sounds, the \"edge\" of the black hole - the horizon inside which an immense gravity field traps all light - may be no more than 20 million km or so across. And at a distance of 26,000 light-years from Earth, this makes Sagittarius A* a tiny pinprick on the sky.\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team is nonetheless bullish. \"There's great excitement,\" said project leader Sheperd Doeleman from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"We've been fashioning our virtual telescope for almost two decades now, and in April we're going to make the observations that we think have the first real chance of bringing a black hole's event horizon into focus,\" he told BBC News.\n\nThe EHT's trick is a technique called very long baseline array interferometry (VLBI). This combines a network of widely spaced radio antennas to mimic a telescope aperture that can produce the resolution necessary to perceive a pinprick on the sky. The EHT is aiming initially to get down to 50 microarcseconds.\n\nTeam-members talk in analogies, describing the sharpness of vision as being the equivalent of seeing something the size of a grapefruit on the surface of the Moon. They emphasize the still complex years of work ahead, but also trail the prospect of an imminent breakthrough.\n\nThe scientists certainly have an expectation of what they ought to see, if successful. Simulations rooted in Einstein's equations predict a bright ring of light fringing a dark feature. The light would be the emission coming from gas and dust accelerated to high speed and torn apart just before disappearing into the hole. The dark feature would be the shadow the hole casts on this maelstrom.\n\n\"Now, it could be that we will see something different,\" Doeleman said. \"As I've said before, it's never a good idea to bet against Einstein, but if we did see something that was very different from what we expect we would have to reassess the theory of gravity.\n\n\"I don't expect that is going to happen, but anything could happen and that's the beauty of science. This is why we're doing this - to push the boundaries of our knowledge and to unravel the mysteries of the universe,\" he added.\n\nSo, mark your calendars for April 5th to 14th, as the Event Horizon Telescope embarks on its epic quest to capture the first ever image of a black hole. The anticipation is palpable, and the scientific community is buzzing with excitement. Will we finally be able to witness the silhouette of this cosmic enigma, or will we discover a surprise that challenges our understanding of the universe?

By Mariya Petkova\n\nIn recent weeks, the Turkish-led Operation Euphrates Shield has made significant progress against ISIL around the city of Al Bab in northern Syria. Russia, a key ally during the operation, has provided Turkey with military and diplomatic support. The takeover of Al Bab would effectively prevent Kurdish forces from establishing a land corridor between the two territories they control in northern Syria - one of the main goals of Turkey's military operation. It would also provide Turkey with an important strategic advantage in possible operations against the ISIL, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which is also known as ISIS, and Kurdish forces. But analysts say that Ankara's plans to push further east and south might face serious diplomatic challenges.\n\nOn Sunday during a press conference, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced that Turkish troops had entered Al Bab's city centre and that it was only \"a matter of time\" before they took it over completely.

However, it will take a few weeks for them to take full control of Al Bab, he says.\n\n\"As the Turkish operations go deeper into [fighting] street-by-street, there will be more intensified, nastier defence by the ISIS elements,\" said Kasapoglu. \"We always see this. We saw this in Iraq, we saw this in Ramadi. When ISIS feel that the tide is turning against them they go apocalyptic, but it cannot stop the operation.\"\n\nTurkey launched Operation Euphrates Shield in August 2016 with a coalition of Syrian Arab and Turkmen forces, backed by a few hundred Turkish troops. As fighting progressed, Ankara had to send reinforcements and currently, according to Kasapoglu, Turkish troops on the ground in northern Syria are in the thousands. The Operation Euphrates Shield forces started their advance on Al Bab in November 2016.\n\nIn early February, ISIL was completely encircled after armed forces fighting for Bashar al-Assad's regime cut off its last remaining supply route connecting it to the rest of its territories south and east of Al Bab. This positioned regime forces in close proximity to FSA factions, and according to Kasapoglu, that resulted in minor clashes.\n\nOsama al-Koshak, an independent Syrian researcher and activist, says there is very little risk of more serious clashes happening between FSA affiliates and regime forces in Al Bab. He added that there has been an agreement between Turkey and Russia on Syrian regime forces halting their progress at the village of Tadif, just 2km southeast of Al Bab.\n\nIn mid-January, Russia and Turkey launched their first joint air operations, hitting ISIL positions in Al Bab. The military cooperation between the two countries suffered a temporary setback when Russian air strikes killed three Turkish soldiers. Despite these issues, Koshak says Russian-Turkish cooperation in northern Syria has been growing and will continue.\n\nAs Turkey continues its mission to neutralize ISIL and prevent Kurdish forces from expanding further, the situation in Al Bab remains tense. The city's capture would undoubtedly be a significant victory for the Turkish-led forces, but the path forward may not be without its challenges. As analysts and observers keep a close watch on developments, one thing remains clear - when the tide turns against ISIL, they go apocalyptic in their defense, but the determination of the Turkish forces cannot be stopped.", "mask": 1512}, {"article": "Mark Zuckerberg has revealed deep-seated concerns that the tide is turning against globalisation. In an interview with the BBC, the Facebook founder said that fake news, polarised views and \"filter bubbles\" were damaging \"common understanding\". He said people had been left behind by global growth, sparking demands to \"withdraw\" from the \"connected world\". In a call to action, he said people must not \"sit around and be upset\", but act to build \"social infrastructures\".\n\n\"When I started Facebook, the mission of connecting the world was not controversial,\" he told me. \"It was as if it was a default assumption that people had; every year the world got more connected and that seems like the direction things were heading in. Now that vision is becoming more controversial.\"\n\nHe told the BBC: \"There are people around the world that feel left behind by globalisation and the rapid changes that have happened, and there are movements as a result to withdraw from some of that global connection.\"\n\nMr Zuckerberg's interview comes alongside the publication of a 5,500-word letter he has written about the future of Facebook and the global economy. In it, Mr Zuckerberg quotes Abraham Lincoln who spoke of acting \"in concert,\" and talks about \"spiritual needs,\" civic engagement, and says that many people have \"lost hope for the future.\"\n\n\"For a couple of decades, maybe longer, people have really sold this idea that as the world comes together everything is going to get better,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the reality is that over the long term that will be true, and there are pieces of infrastructure that we can build to make sure that a global community works for everyone.

I think that answer is clearly yes.\"\n\n\"But we have to make sure the global community works for everyone. It is not just automatically going to happen.\"\n\n\"All these different kinds of institutions, whether they are governments or non-profits or companies, need to do their part in building this infrastructure to empower people so that it creates opportunities for everyone, not just some people.\"\n\n\"If you are upset about the direction things are going in, I hope you don't just sit around and be upset, but you feel urgent about building the long term infrastructure that needs to get built,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.\n\nI asked him whether he felt President Trump agreed with his view that \"bringing people together\" and \"connecting the world\" would lead to greater progress. Mr Zuckerberg did not, famously, attend the round-table of technology leaders hosted by the new president.\n\n\"I don't think I am going to speak to that directly,\" he answered carefully. \"You can talk to him. You can look at what he has said to get a sense of that.\"\n\n\"The thing that I will say is that a lot of folks will look at this through the lens of one or two events, and I really do think this is a broader trend.\"\n\n\"I have been talking about this for a long time, since before recent elections both across Europe and Asia and the US.\"\n\n\"A lot of today's biggest opportunities will come from bringing people together - whether that is spreading prosperity or freedom, or accelerating science, or promoting peace and understanding.\"\n\nMr Zuckerberg said: \"A lot of challenges we face today are also entirely global - fighting climate change or ending terrorism or ending pandemics, or when a civil war in one country leads to a refugee crisis across different continents.\"\n\n\"These are inherently global things and require a different level of infrastructure than we've had historically.\"\n\nWould you like to meet President Trump?

The latest attempts to restrict the operations of non-governmental organizations that are mostly involved in human rights work took place last week when Egyptian authorities physically sealed shut the doors of the El Nadeem Centre, a prominent NGO that helps victims of violence and torture. \n\n\"This is a big hit - a unique and significant one - in light of the government's crackdown against civil society in Egypt,\" Suzan Fayad, the centre's director told Al Jazeera. Al Nadeem Centre for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture has been operating as a registered clinic with the health ministry for the past 24 years, according to Fayad.\n\nIn response to the centre's closure, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said: \"Instead of tackling the pernicious pattern of police torture, President [Abdel Fattah]-el-Sisi sends the police to seal the clinic that helps the victims and has been a vital source of information about deaths in detention, denial of medical care, and abuse by law enforcement officers.\" \"The move against Al-Nadeem Centre sends the message loud and clear that al-Sisi's government won't confront torture and will do its best to silence critical voices,\" Joe Stork, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at HRW, said.\n\nEven volunteer work will become subject to total supervision under the pretext of national security. This mentality of maintaining public security has reached a level of madness. Suzan Fayad, director of el-Nadeem centre\n\nAl Nadeem has been fighting a legal battle against its closure for a year now since an initial closure order was first issued in February 2016. The centre's lawyer, Taher Abu al-Nasr, told Al Jazeera that the latest order targeted the clinic, not the center's operational offices, but the police closed both down. \"There is no legal reason for them to close down the centre, it is politically motivated, and no one informed us what the alleged violation cited in the order actually is,\" Abu al-Nasr said.\n\nAbu al-Nasr added that Al-Nadeem centre's members were committed to reopening it, and that the case was pending a final verdict. \"We stopped documenting torture cases for the public reports two years ago. It is extremely important for us to document first-hand accounts, to prove what torture methods are being used in prisons,\" Fayad explained. \"We've been doing it for 20 years, but we are now too worried about our victims' safety and wellbeing - so we had to stop [making it public].\" \n\nAl Nadeem caters for about 250 cases a month, including new victims, according to Fayad. Over the span of 20 years, the centre has documented 14,700 torture cases, and 1,000 cases of domestic abuse, the details of each case are now accessible to the Egyptian authorities in the aftermath of the raid.\n\nThe closure of Al-Nadeem is part of the wider crackdown on civil society in Egypt. Last November, a new bill that was approved by the Egyptian parliament stated that centers of all types would need to re-register themselves as NGOs under the ministry of social affairs, regardless of what services they offer. The law, referred to as the \"NGO law,\" places restrictions on the formation of civil society organizations as much as their general activities, both of which will be subject to security intervention, according to the law. It will come into full effect if the president signs the decree.\n\nFayad described the draft law as \"the worst in Egyptian history\". \"It puts an end to the very last platform available for people who want to peacefully organize. It restricts the operational space of every kind of organization and puts them under the ministry's direct supervision,\" she said. \"Even volunteer work will become subject to total supervision under the pretext of national security.

By 'Invisible wall' 'Border security'-\n\nMexico City, Mexico - When Donald Trump kicked off his campaign for the US presidency with the notorious line about Mexican migrants \"bringing drugs, bringing crime, they're rapists\" it scandalized everyone south of the Rio Grande. When he signed off on his border wall, still insisting Mexico pay for it, the indignation went off the scale. Tens of thousands marched through Mexico City in opposition this Sunday while the government has earmarked $50m for consular protection for its citizens stateside. President Enrique Pena Nieto has personally welcomed back some of the first to be deported under the Trump administration in a show of unity - and condemnation of the now even tougher stance against undocumented migrants of the US.\n\nBut the Mexican government's concern about how its citizens are treated in the US sits incongruously with its own attitude towards the migrants passing through Mexico which rights organizations have described as hypocritical. In July 2014, the government unveiled a new plan called \"Programa Frontera Sur\" - after the US exerted pressure on the country to stop a surge in the number of child migrants heading from Central America to the states. \"Frontera Sur\" was ostensibly designed to protect migrants, but it actually resulted in a noticeable increase in the number of checkpoints and border patrols in the south of the country. What analysts and activists have dubbed Mexico's own \"invisible wall\" succeeded in doubling the number of deportations from the country in the first full year of its implementation.\n\nThere's always been double talk - it seems that the Central American migrants don't matter, nothing is done to prevent the same human rights violations that Mexican migrants suffer in the US. Diego Lorente, a lawyer, expressed his concerns about the Mexican authorities' attitude towards migration. \"There's always been double talk - it seems that the Central American migrants don't matter, nothing is done to prevent the same human rights violations that Mexican migrants suffer in the US,\" Lorente said.\n\nThose caught by authorities often end up in what is the biggest migrant detention center in Latin America, built in the tropical border town, Tapachula. Here, many people from Central American nations below Mexico, like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, wait in the sweltering heat for their turn to be bussed back home. Frequently, they are being sent back to grinding poverty or the vicious gang violence that they fled in the first place. In recent years, Honduras and El Salvador have both vied for the title of the world's most murderous country outside of a war zone. NGOs have set up shop in the town to help some stay in Mexico.\n\nDiego Lorente, a bearded lawyer who has been fighting for the rights of migrants for several years, told Al Jazeera there's a double standard in the Mexican authorities' attitude towards migration. \"There's always been double talk - it seems that the Central American migrants don't matter, nothing is done to prevent the same human rights violations that Mexican migrants suffer in the US,\" Lorente said.\n\nState authorities admit some Mexican officials are involved in the extortion, robbery, rape, and even kidnapping of migrants. Alejandro Vila Chavez, the prosecutor for crimes against migrants in the southern state of Chiapas, told Al Jazeera that last October, his team burst open a ring of 21 local policemen who had kidnapped a group of migrants in the town of Chiapa de Corzo. \"They don't have the training to make them aware of their important duties,\" he said, speaking particularly about municipal police. \"Unfortunately, they lose sight of their responsibilities, and some become involved in criminal activities.\"\n\nThe situation raises serious questions about Mexico's commitment to human rights and its treatment of migrants. While the government strongly denounces the mistreatment of Mexican migrants in the US, it needs to address the double standard it applies to migrants passing through its own borders. As activists and organizations continue to shine a light on these issues, it is essential for Mexico to take proactive measures to protect the rights and well-being of all migrants, regardless of their nationality.

The protests, which were organized on social media, are also a demonstration against President Donald Trump, who has been criticized by some as anti-immigrant and xenophobic for his promises to deport unauthorized immigrants, build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and use \"extreme vetting\" on immigrants from several predominantly Muslim countries. Hundreds of business owners in Washington, D.C., Austin, Boston, Philadelphia, and other cities are participating in the protests.\n\n\"I want to make sure that immigrants, such as myself and others, don't live in fear,\" said Andy Shallal, an Iraq-American entrepreneur best known for his D.C.-area restaurant, bookstore, and performance venue chain Busboys and Poets. Shallal told ABC News he decided to close all six of his Busboy and Poets locations today to push for \"humanistic\" immigration reform. \"There are times when standing on the sidelines is not an option,\" he said. \"This is one of those times.\"\n\nWhile the economic impact of today's boycotts remains unclear, several economic experts told ABC News that the U.S. economy and workforce would be a \"disaster\" without immigrants. \"If all immigrants were just to disappear from the U.S. workforce tomorrow, that would have a tremendous negative impact on the economy,\" said Daniel Costa, the director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, an economic research think tank based in Washington, D.C. \"Immigrants are over-represented in a lot of occupations in both low- and high-skilled jobs,\" Costa explained. \"You'd feel an impact and loss in many, many different occupations and industries from construction and landscape to finance and I.T.\" Though some U.S.-born workers could fill some of those jobs, large gaps in several sectors would remain and cause a decline in the economy, Costa said.\n\nImmigrants earned $1.3 trillion and contributed $105 billion in state and local taxes - as well as nearly $224 billion in federal taxes - in 2014, according to the Partnership for a New American Economy, based on an analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau's latest American Community Survey. The partnership is a group of 500 Republican, Democratic and independent mayors and business leaders who support immigration reforms that create jobs for Americans, according to its site. As consumers, immigrants had almost $927 billion in spending power in 2014, an analysis of the survey showed. \"Immigrants are a very vital part of what makes the U.S. economy work,\" Jeremy Robbins, the executive director of the Partnership for a New American Economy, told ABC News. \"They help drive every single sector and industry in the country.\"\n\nThe Day Without Immigrants is shedding light on the undeniable contributions of immigrants to the fabric of American society. It highlights the vital role they play in sustaining various economic sectors and emphasizes the repercussions of neglecting their presence. With immigrants earning a staggering $1.3 trillion and paying billions of dollars in taxes, it is evident that their absence would have severe consequences for the economy.\n\nDaniel Costa from the Economic Policy Institute warns that if immigrants were to suddenly vanish from the U.S. workforce, it would be catastrophic. Immigrants are already prevalent in a wide range of occupations, spanning from low-skilled jobs like construction and landscaping to high-skilled sectors like finance and technology. Filling this void would prove challenging for native-born workers, leading to significant gaps in the labor market.\n\nMoreover, the purchasing power of immigrants cannot be understated. Their collective spending power amounts to approximately $927 billion, further fueling economic growth and job creation. Jeremy Robbins, the executive director of the Partnership for a New American Economy, emphasizes the undeniable truth that immigrants are the lifeblood of the U.S. economy, driving all sectors and industries.\n\nThe Day Without Immigrants serves as a powerful reminder that immigrants are an integral part of the United States.

I knew the words to Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika and called Harold Washington my mayor, even though I lived in the suburbs.\n\nMy parents had immigrated to the United States from Sudan in the late 1970s and raised my sister and me to be comfortable in our skin. I spoke Arabic at home and English at school where it seemed no one else agreed that I am black. When my father registered me for kindergarten, the school administrator told him that we had to select a box to designate our race.\n\nMy father - raised in a post-colonial Sudan mired in ethnic tensions and civil war - wondered aloud why the government was tracking pupils based on race. The administrator recommended that since Arabic is the language spoken at home, we should mark \"white\". My father, whose adolescence was shaped by Frantz Fanon, Patrice Lumumba, and Malcolm X, laughed. \n\nHe patted his conspicuous Afro and wryly said, \"We may speak Arabic at home, but you can clearly see that we are black.\" My experience highlights the absurdity of US racial classifications.\n\nThe US Census Bureau classifies all Arabic speakers as white, owing partly to the fact that the earliest Arabic-speaking immigrants to the US were Levantine Christians who could, and wanted to, pass for white. US history is defined by centuries of rigid racial hierarchy, with enslaved Africans and their descendants at the bottom of the heap.\n\nCatholics, Jews, and southern European immigrants were not automatically granted whiteness and its legal benefits (PDF). But by the 20th-century, if a man looked white, he enjoyed full benefits of citizenship. But if he looked or was suspected of being black, then he would have to contend with racist laws designed to disenfranchise and terrify African Americans.\n\nThe immigration of non-Europeans threw a wrench into this system. Early 20th-century Arab immigrants were not interested in being on the wrong end of Jim Crow laws and did not want to live as non-citizens like some Asian immigrants. They petitioned the government to grant them legal whiteness, and it did.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s began to chip away at systemic racism. The Arabic-speakers who immigrated to the United States after the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, including my parents, were much more diverse than the previous waves. Most of the newcomers, who included people from 10 African countries, could not pass for white even if they wanted to.\n\nMy elementary school wanted to designate me as white because Arabic is my mother tongue, but no one was under any illusion that I actually was a white person. Rather, the question was: as an Afro-Arab, am I black enough to be considered racially black in America?\n\nSudanese Americans' racial identities are often erased. Ahmed Mohamed, the so-called Clock Boy, was described as \"brown\" by many commentators as if he was South Asian. Famously, Aziz Ansari, the Indian American actor, tweeted that he stands with Ahmed, \"because I was once a brown kid in the south, too.\" \n\nI am a Muslim woman who wears a headscarf; I cannot point to an Afro to prove my blackness. Like Ahmed, I am neither black nor brown, I am just me. And that should be enough.\n\nThe complexities of racial identity are far from black and white in the United States. As the blending of cultures and ethnicities continues, our understanding of race must evolve too. It is time to move beyond restrictive labels and embrace the diversity that exists within racial categories.\n\nWe must celebrate the rich tapestry of backgrounds that make up our nation, acknowledging that racial identity is not a rigid box to be ticked but rather a fluid and multifaceted aspect of who we are as individuals and as a society.\n\nSo, the next time someone tries to put you in a box based on your race, remember that the true measure of your identity lies within yourself, and no classification can define the essence of your being.

From voicing these views, from galvanizing others, from standing up for others that may not be able to, and most importantly, from sharing my unique talents to further not just my family, friends, self, and at times my wallet, but my community.\n\nAnd in this \"BET!\" moment, I realized that despite the fact that our beloved, and gosh are they beloved First Family and fearless 44th President takes leave, that we missed something when he won. Something that, lastly as every ounce of his days in office and legacy was the introduction to the power of grassroots movements and additionally the potential impact that young people can have when they unite with a common purpose.\n\nSo, my fellow millennials, it's time to step up our game. It's time to channel our energy, frustration, and determination into something meaningful. It's time to use our voices, talents, and skills to create change and ensure that our generation is represented and protected in the years to come.\n\nYes, we may be feeling uncertain about the future, but let us embrace the challenge and let it fuel our fire for positive action. Let us strive to make a difference, not just for ourselves but for all those who may need our support and advocacy.\n\nPresident Trump may have taken office, but that doesn't mean we have to sit back and watch passively. It's time to make our voices heard, to stand up for what we believe in, and to work towards a brighter future for all.\n\nSo, my fellow millennials, let's unite, let's empower, and let's show the world what we're capable of.

It was an accident.\" \n\nA Georgia jury made up of six men and six women in November found Harris guilty on eight counts, including malice murder and two counts of felony murder, for the death of their son, Cooper Harris. He was sentenced to life without parole. The boy was pronounced dead on June 18, 2014, after authorities said he spent about seven hours alone in a rear-facing car seat in Harris's locked SUV in the Atlanta area. Temperatures in the area had reached the low 90s outside that day. Authorities ruled that Cooper died of hyperthermia. \n\nTaylor said she first learned something was wrong when she went to Cooper's daycare that afternoon to pick him up. \"The daycare teacher...said, 'Well, Cooper's not here.' and I thought she was joking, and I was like, 'No really, where's Cooper?' Taylor said. \"And she just looked me dead in the face and got my attention. She was like, 'He's not here.'

Later that day, after Harris went back again to his car and drove away from work, then he pulled over in a shopping center parking lot where he asked for help, authorities say. \n\nAuthorities argued that Harris going back to the car at lunch proved he knew Cooper was still there, but Taylor sees it differently. \"The going back to the car part actually for me solidifies that it wasn't intentional,\" she said. \"To me, it said the opposite, that he didn't have a clue Cooper was there.\" \n\nDetectives zeroed in on Harris, but said they were also suspicious of Taylor because they thought her actions that day seemed strange. She had told daycare workers that \"Ross must have left him in the car\" and detectives said she seemed unemotional when she was told Cooper was dead. Most suspicious, police said, was that while Harris was awaiting questioning at the police station, Taylor was recorded asking him, \"Did you say too much?\" \n\nLater, at Cooper's funeral, eyewitnesses reported that she seemed unemotional, and that she told people Cooper seemed to be in a better place. Taylor, who was never arrested or charged in the case, said she was just trying to process what had happened. \"Nothing about it felt real. Nothing about it felt like it was happening. It just felt like a bad dream,\" Taylor said. \n\n\"Ty faith is the only thing that has kept me alive since this happened. The only thing that could give me any kind of peace was knowing that Cooper was in a good place... People took it as me not wanting him here. \"If I could bring Cooper back to me, of course I would bring him back,\" she added. \n\nSince the funeral, Taylor said she has been the target of horrific bullying, both in person and online. She said she was barred at first from getting her son's belongings from his daycare and she said someone left a note on Cooper's grave saying, \"If you had been my son, I would have loved you.\" \n\n\"There's no way for someone to truly understand the pain and grief I have experienced,\" Taylor shared. \"But what I want people to know is that supporting Justin does not mean I don't mourn the loss of my son. It means that I believe in forgiveness and that I still care about him as a person despite the tragic events that took place. Justin was a loving father, and Cooper was his world. It's important for me to remember that, even in the midst of this heartbreaking situation.\"\n\nWhile some may find it difficult to comprehend Taylor's stance, it serves as a reminder of the complexity of human emotions and the different ways people cope with unimaginable tragedy. The interview with Leanna Taylor sheds light on the aftermath of a devastating event and invites us to reflect on how forgiveness and compassion can coexist in the face of immense pain.

Two high-value-notes - the 500 rupee ($7.5) and 1,000 rupee ($14.9) - would no longer be legal tender, he said. The move had been taken to combat \"black money\" or unaccounted income, which makes up nearly one fifth of India's economy, he said. But much of the country's largely cash-based society screeched to a halt. Daily-wage labourers and other poor Indians were particularly hard hit. Here, seven Indians share their stories of demonetisation.\n\nMonika cannot forget the hardships her family endured in the two months following Modi's decision to ban 86 percent of the country's currency. Standing inside the cramped kitchen of her family's one-bedroom home, she explains that her husband, who works as a security guard at a private school in Ludhiana city, went without pay for two months as the school ran out of cash. The family of four, including the couple's 21-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son, relied on her husband's 9,000 rupee ($135) monthly-salary and, without it, they were sometimes forced to go without food. \n\n\"My family slept without food for days,\" the housewife explains. \"I will never forget ... that demonetisation brought us to the brink of begging for food.\" \n\nWith her eyes fixed on the kitchen window, she says: \"We aren't beggars that we will go on the streets asking people for money.\" And even if they had, she explains, none of their neighbours would have been able to help them. \"All of us are poor in this area and everyone was struggling like us,\" she says. The note ban - or notebandi as it is commonly referred to - hit poor people, like those in Monika's neighbourhood, hardest.\n\nMonika, who goes by just one name, says life still has not returned to normal. Her husband is now being paid again but in instalments. In a country where about 90 percent of transactions are made in cash, demonetisation forced millions to stand in queues in front of banks as they tried to exchange the banned currency. But, Monika says, she didn't have to queue. \"We don't have a bank account as we are poor,\" she says, before adding: \"I don't know how demonetisation will help my future, but it turned my present life into a nightmare.\" Monika's story has many parallels in the government-built Economically Weaker Section housing society where she lives in Ludhiana's Samrala Chowk area. \n\nTwenty-nine-year-old Hemlata is her neighbour and has also fallen on hard times as her husband lost his job when the factory he worked in closed down due to the cash crunch. Hemlata, who goes by just one name, is sitting in the housing society's courtyard with some other women. It is the only open area in the otherwise cramped and squalid neighbourhood of approximately 30 small concrete homes. To make up for her husband's lost income, Hemlata has started working part-time.\n\n\"My neighbour has given me this work where I process [cut] these shawls and get 0.50 paisa [half a rupee] for every piece. I process around 50 to 60 pieces in a day,\" she explains, sitting amid piles of shawls with her three-year-old daughter. But the 45 cents she makes daily is not enough to cover the family's most basic expenses. \"This is a very small amount and it is not enough to get us one meal a day. And I have to also pay the rent, electricity and school fees,\" she says, her voice breaking. \"I will have to manage, till my husband is able to find a job.\"\n\nOn top of those expenses, she must also buy medicine for her two-year-old daughter, who has suffered from a chronic disease since birth. \"My daughter needs her medicine every day and I have to resort to borrowing money from neighbours and moneylenders to buy it.\" \"How am I going to repay that money?\" she asks.\n\nAlthough the 7,000 rupees ($105) that her husband used to earn in the factory was far below the country's average monthly wage of about $250, it helped the family of four get by. But for the past two months, her husband has been unable to find a new job.\n\nLudhiana is a large industrial city, known for its hosiery industry. But more than 70 percent of the city's 12,000 hosiery factories, which employed more than 400,000 people, shut down because of the demonetisation. Hemlata is angry that the government's decision led to her husband's redundancy.\n\n\"I think all the schemes of the government are for the rich, and the poor are never considered,\" she says. \"Please tell me if you heard of those with black money sleeping on an empty stomach because of demonetisation.\"\n\nAs she cuts a shawl, Hemlata says that the government should have made provisions for poor people like her. \"This is a disaster,\" she concludes. \"I don't see my life becoming normal again.\"\n\n\"I don't know how demonetisation helped, but it was a disaster for the unskilled labor sector,\" says Rajwinder Singh. Rajwinder is the president of the Karkhana Mazdoor Union, or factory workers' union, in Ludhiana and is sitting in the small community library of the Economically Weaker Section-housing society.\n\n\"It left people jobless, starving and desperate,\" he says. Immediately after demonetisation was announced, the wholesale market was closed for 20 days, Rajwinder says.\n\n\"When the market was closed, there was no sale and the factories had to stop production and as a result many factories cut down the number of employees by 50 percent, while many just shut the shop,\" he says. \"I have seen factories that used to have 250 workers and post-demonetisation were reduced to five workers.\"\n\nThe softly-spoken, bespectacled union leader said that migrant laborers from the states of Bihar, West Bengal, and Uttar Pradesh, who had come to Ludhiana for work, had no choice but to return home. \"It was a hand-to-mouth situation for them and when they had no food, they had no other option,\" he says.\n\nNand Kishore, a 22-year-old unemployed former factory worker, shares Rajwinder's sentiments. \"Demonetisation was not only disastrous but also unfair,\" he says. \"The rich had their money withdrawn without any problems as they can afford the inconvenience and have the resources, but the poor suffered the most.\"\n\nBut the impact of demonetisation goes beyond mere inconvenience for some. Parminder Singh, a 30-year-old factory supervisor, experienced a devastating loss due to demonetisation. He recounts the heart-wrenching story of his mother's death.\n\n\"My mother was suffering from a severe illness and we needed money to get her admitted to a hospital,\" he says. \"But because of demonetisation, we couldn't access our own money. We couldn't pay the hospital bills, and sadly, my mother passed away.\"\n\nParminder is bitter about the fact that if he had the privilege of being rich, he could have easily used his card to get his mother the treatment she needed. But for people like him, who relied on cash, demonetisation proved to be a barrier to vital medical care.\n\nYamuna Prasad, a 29-year-old factory worker, also shares Parminder's sentiments. \"People who think demonetisation was a good move have probably never had to go through the hardships we faced,\" she says. \"A rich man would have used his card to get his mother admitted to a hospital, but what about people like me?\"\n\nAnisa Khatoon, a 48-year-old housewife, echoes the challenges faced by many during demonetisation. \"It took me years to save that money,\" she says. \"And in a matter of hours, it became useless.\"\n\nThe stories of Monika, Hemlata, Rajwinder, Nand Kishore, Parminder, Yamuna, and Anisa shed light on the diverse range of hardships faced by ordinary Indians as a result of demonetisation. From job losses to struggling to afford basic necessities, it is clear that the government's decision had a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable members of society.\n\nAs the 100-day milestone since demonetisation approaches, it is important to reflect on the real-life consequences of such a policy. While the intention may have been to combat \"black money,\" it is evident that the cost borne by ordinary citizens has been immense.\n\nAs the nation looks to the future, it is crucial to consider the voices and experiences of those who have been most affected by demonetisation. Only by listening to their stories and addressing their concerns can India's economic policies truly benefit all its citizens.", "mask": 646}]
