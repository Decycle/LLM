Close your eyes, and tell me what do you see[/INST]

I see myself in vivid detail, standing within what feels like end of life, abandoned laborious. The once vicious and vibrant hellscape is now nothing but a lifeless, barren wasteland, devoid of life or vitality. The skull-like rocks that litter the ground beneath my feet are worn smooth by the endless passage of time, their jagged edges glistening like the teeth of a predator.
The laborious itself is a massive, hulking beast of a machine, its once gleaming metal skin now rusted and crumbling, its limbs splayed out like the limbs of a dead god. The air is thick with the stench of decay and death, and the only sound is the endless, mournful howl of the wind.
I see the remnants of humanity scattered throughout the wasteland, their once proud and vibrant civilization reduced to nothing but shattered ruins and the faintest whispers of a forgotten language. The buildings stand like ghosts, their crumbling walls and twisted steel beams a testament to the end that came for all of us.
And yet, even in death, there is beauty to be found. The way the light filters through the broken glass of the skyscrapers, casting intricate patterns on the ground. The way the shadows dance across the ruins, giving life to the lifeless. The way the wind carries the whispers of the past, a haunting reminder of what once was.
I see all of this, and yet, I am alone. The last of my kind, left to wander this desolate landscape, searching for answers that may never come. The end of life has come, and with it, the end of all that once was. And yet, even in the face of such finality, there is a strange beauty to be found. A beauty that speaks to the enduring power of life, even in the face of death itself.</s><s> The Ultimate Guide to the Best Time to Visit Hawaii
