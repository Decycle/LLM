"Wrong drink. Spilled drink. Womp, womp, womp.

Dined in on Black Friday with a few of my friends because I wanted cheesy carbs. While California Pizza Kitchen still remains the forgettable dine-in option, it's still a go-to when visiting KOP mall. 

Our waitress may have been super busy or just a new waitress in general. My friends who both ordered the same strawberry lemonade received two different drinks. The waitress who stood above us as my friends spoke aloud that they ordered the same drink but received different drinks quickly walked away. Of course not before spilling part of the drink across the table. WOMP. Rookie mistake. 

On the back side of the menu you'll notice a lunch special available Monday-Friday with deals ranging from $10.99 to $12.99. I opted for the pizza and soup combo. Because carbs on carbs is better than no carbs or carbs and veggies. EWWWW. 

Mushroom Sausage Pepperoni Pizza: At least the dough was good. I'd say there wasn't enough cheese on my pizza but overall it was a solid 3/5. 

Baked Potato Soup: Did not finish. Tasted like flour. The end.

"Had a graduation lunch for 11 guests. I would say the food is great. Cocktails were excellent, but a couple things really made me lower the review. The first was a few in the party kept empty water glasses for more than half of the meal. The reservation was towards the end of the brunch service. We had a few gifts/envelopes. We asked the server if we could sit them at the end of the next table. She said of course and that no one was going to be sat there until dinner service. GREAT. We sat the gifts there. About 10 minutes later a young hostess comes over and starts chatting with a guest of the family about the gifts and how they needed to seat a party. Well - they never sat a party. Lastly, another person came and chatted with my mother about a cake cutting fee for the graduation cake. I'm fine with a fee, but any issue a restaurant wants to discuss should be discussed with the reservation holder - not guests of the reservation holder. If you're going to charge a cutting fee and hold yourself out to be a finer dining establishment - have the quality of service as a finer dining establishment. Also have the candor and etiquette to match what you're professing. 

My advice - if you're looking to have a special occasion with more than 4 individuals - choose another place. If you're wanting a great dinner with a couple friends or spouse - this is excellent.",1,0.953125,5.0,2.0349944e-11,3.828125,0.0032196045,2.75,1.0,2.265625,2.0116568e-06,2.8125,2.4586916e-07,3.484375,8.821487e-06,2.109375

"Last stop in NOLA and it was a good one! We stopped by around 11am and the line was long! But don't be deceived; we were in the door within 20 minutes. The way Mother's runs is different than your typical restaurant. You walk in and you wait in line to order food with the cashier. You would then take your receipt, find an empty table, and wait for a waiter to take your receipt and actually get your order going.
After finding a table, it took about 10 minutes or so to get the waiter's attention to take our receipt. In addition, it took another 15-20 minutes to get our food.
We ordered the Half Fried Chicken (breast, thigh, leg, wing) which comes with 2 sides for $15. I went with the French fries and beans & rice. I also got a freshly squeezed Orange Juice for ~$3 and their homemade biscuit for ~$2.
The fried chicken was really good, in my opinion. The fries were pretty addicting but they weren't out of the ordinary. The biscuit was soft but I wish it was warm. It also comes with butter and grape jelly.

We had absolutely no issues with finding a bite to eat as there are plenty of restaurants to fit every style and every budget.   The bellman service was really slow.

"Running errands and in need of a quick lunch, so I stopped by the Atomic Cowboy. It was late lunchtime, closer to 1then 12. I picked a stool at my favorite place to dine, the bar. 

I started out with one of the neighbors down the street craft beers, UCBC Forest Park Pils. It's always one of my favorites, I order it all the time when I'm at UCBC. As I studied the menu, Poutinelicious jumped out at me. I wasn't that hungry, but wanted to satisfy the hunger pains. The menu described it as crispy fries topped with, smoked chicken, cheese curds, burnt onions and chicken love. I will say the toppings were correct and they did add flavor to the fries. However, I thought the fries were limp before the toppings were added. Should have gone with the Swordfish Tacos. 

Service was a little lack luster. The staff seemed more pre-occupied with doing prep work and getting prepared for the evening business.

"Awesome homemade ice cream!! Great selection of flavors, preparations, and at decent prices. Tucked into Wayne and a great place to bring the family. Parking is not bad, just be watchful for the long lines. 

We came here after a disappointing dinner somewhere at A place to never be mentioned again, in Wayne.  As we rolled-up, were a little daunted by the long line, but knew this place was going to be good because of the line. We gazed at the menu and were amazed by the shear number of flavors and selections of preparations for ice cream and frozen yogurt. I tired a couple flavors like chocolate cake batter and buckeye which were delicious. My friend enjoyed the graham central station. The servers were cool and patient. They also placed the ice cream in the cones properly with large to small scoops. I was pleased that the seemed knowledgable at flavors, taste, textures, and placement.

"Ok ST what's the deal? As locals we have enjoyed this food many times. But recently, your changes have made us not want to eat at your establishment again. We tried to order delivery one night, mind you an hour and a half before you we're closing, and were told by Lisa Marie that it would not be possible to get an order to us that night. We live 3 blocks away. That's lazy and a serious customer service issue. And tonight, we decided to once again try to get something delivered. We were told we could only pay cash and there would be a 15% surcharge for delivery. These are two things never asked of us before. These changes are a little ridiculous considering that in a few weeks you will be surviving off of local business, and most will pass you up for a more friendly establishment willing to help those that live here and help them, as well. Needless to say, though your food is decent, we will not be back. Tourists, do what you will, we all know you will go where you will and spend ridiculous amounts of money on half decent food.

Service was good. Sangria (red) was very good. And the tapas we had all disappeared quickly.

"I went to the Barcelona Wine Bar yesterday (Sunday afternoon at about 4pm) with my husband. The place just opened, and I was very pleasantly impressed with everything. The service was a very pleasant experience and very well organized.

Valeria and Kay were the two ladies who help me decide what was the best thing to try (I wanted to try everything). Every person who approached our table was very personable, friendly, and used the right tone when talking to us.

The staff is a great reflection of the diversity of the neighborhood (something very refreshing, real diversity, as opposed to having people ""representing"").

They did a great job in decorating and designing the space. It flows really well, is very comfortable, has the right amount of tables, patrons are not too close to each other. The decor did remind me of Barcelona.

The menu is very varied within the theme. We had six different types of tapas. Their wine list is extensive. The items in the menu are well laid out, easy to read, understand and follow, and above all, priced right. I feel that I got a reasonable amount and quality of food for what we paid.

The one thing I'd say is that the cocktails were a little frugal for what we paid. They could have had another ounce of liquor. That's the only thing I found slightly overpriced.

All-in-all, it's a great place, pleasant, personable, friendly, diverse staff. Greatly prepared food and delivered in a timely manner, reasonably priced and great quality. Good prices, great facilities. It's a winner in my book.

"Along with Mission BBQ, this is arguably the highlight of the mall and I would definitely like to explore the menu some more.

The gift shop has some genuinely charming (though often overpriced) things in it. I found a stuffed a dachshund for only 12 bucks. The beer hall style is nice, as is the bar up front, where we ate.

The pretzel, which you can get for free if you stop at the kiosk outside, is fine for what it is - it's not terrific, but it's hard to really mess up a pretzel. The Bavarian Onion Soup was very good, with pretzel bits in it to differentiate it from standard French Onion.

We ordered the King Ludwig Platter to try to get a sampling of everything. The meats were all very good, with the Rouladen probably being the best part and the Knackwurst being the most forgettable of the meats.

"After being verbally assaulted by both the owner and bouncer on the night of my batchelorette, this establishment will not be getting any more of our money. We took 2 bus rides through the rain and arrived on the dance floor quite famished. My mom and I got take out from the diner and brought it over to our table in the dance area (we didn't want to be the only ones eating in the diner while everyone else danced). The owner and bouncer (completely unnecessary use of personnel) descended upon us, literally confiscated our boxes out of our hands and told us we could get the food when we leave. We asked if we could please have a refund as we were not interested in cold, soggy pizza at the end of the night. We were denied with a sour attitude as well as being told that the girl at the diner that gave us our food would then have to be fired for giving it to us. We requested to speak to the manager and manager further, where I suggested that the guy manning the door to the dance floor should be penalized, not the waitress (as he saw us bring in the food). They weren't interested in having a conversation; it was clear that they just wanted to manhandle the situation. At this point, I realized that this place was operated by 'roided-up, semi-misogynistic meatheads and we weren't winning this battle. So rather than let it ruin my night, we went back to the dance floor to have a good time, which was happening until the meaty bouncer decided to make another close personal encounter. He was offended that we were dancing with our middle fingers in the air and got in my face (seriously, like 2 inches from my face) about it, asking ""why you gotta disrespect me like that? I see you doing that."" Rather than be a responsible employee with better things to worry about, I guess he wanted to harp on me in my crown, veil and sash. I felt sorry for this guy- his feelings were hurt over such an insignificant gesture which could have been aimed at anybody (but truthfully really was at him). My pity for his feebleness grew when he proceeded to let me know he was an ex-marine. Not exactly sure how that threat would apply in a dance club and directed at a bride to be. Needless to say, we left at that point because I'd much rather stand in the rain than continue to be berated by these lunatics.",0,0.390625,2.6875,0.38476562,2.640625,0.75390625,2.890625,0.41210938,2.609375,0.41992188,2.65625,0.36328125,2.6875,0.41015625,2.625

It is definitely out of sorts from nearly any other coffee shop in New Orleans, it would fit more aptly in San Francisco or NYC, but that makes it a welcome respite from the majority of dingy, shoddy coffee cafes throughout the rest of the Crescent.

Coffee is some of the best in the city, although not up to par with say Stumptown in Portland, Vivace in Seattle, or Cafe Grumpy in NYC, but for New Orleans there is little better.

The server (no name) but friendly, started out pulled together and ready to roll. Brought us waters and menus.  Told us of a brunch menu that we never saw because they apparently only printed a limited number of them.  Then it just goes downhill FAST..Drink orders- ""I will have an Ice Tea"" response-""We are out of Ice Tea!""..WHAT? What rest. EVER runs out of Ice Tea..Fine moving forward..other Drinks order and we placed appetizer order, I order ""Voted Best Wings"" Baked Wings..which were good not ""BEST"", except when the food came out no plates, napkins or silverware. The guy in vest and tie about 7 mins later comes flying by and throws down 4 (what appeared to have once been silverware rolls). Knives and Forks go flying and he never looked back (btw there were 6 of us) finally when our server returned we asked for plates and received the other silverware..(just a note: our server was very nice this whole time)..We order food..I ordered the Chic Pesto Sand with Mashed Potatoes although I really wanted veggies but my only choice was spinach which my sand had already (so a suggestion would be dif veggie) Our food took around 45 mins and when it arrived it looked good..let me mention during this I would randomly see a young lady helping out and she apparently didn't work there but was delivering food and cleaning tables(she was helpful and nice)..So food comes and my Sandwich that had the opportunity to be really good was halted at the fact it was on a Wonder Bread Bun..Yes, do not try to convince me otherwise!! Since, I knew they didnt have Ice tea I was certain they had run out of whatever bread would of make this sandwich great.  I didn't get a chance to look again at a menu to see what the bread was suppose to be but I made sure to tell the server that Wonder Bread was not it!!

Food
     Calamari Fries
A crispy golden brown exterior that's delectable. Squeeze fresh  lemon and it makes a great starter to share. 

     Ghost Pepper Sliders
The lingering heat of the Ghost Pepper chili's creates a beautiful balance of heat and flavor from the burger patty. 

     Royal Flush
My favorite burger is the Royal Flush. A very juicy and flavorful burger that tastes as good as it looks.  Mushrooms, blue cheese, and a spring green mix all on top of a toasted bun. Tasty!  

    Jackpot Burger
 The first half I ate was much better than the 2nd half.  A very filling burger that gets a little sloppy with the huge amount of food they pile on.  Too many ingredients creating one mushy texture in my mouth. 

Atmosphere
The atmosphere is casual. Usually a good crowd of 14 people dispersed around the bar having private conversations. My guest and I enjoyed the comfy seating at the bar.

During UFC Fight nights The Beave gets loud and packed with crowds creating a high energy fun atmosphere.

A good place to go if your surroundings make a big difference but otherwise you can get better Mexican food in Tucson for less money.,1,1.0,3.015625,0.1953125,4.96875,0.859375,4.9375,2.5579538e-13,4.125,1.0,1.8359375,0.00015735626,2.390625,4.618528e-13,3.375

"Long John Silvers sounded awesome for dinner. We got to the restaurant at 5:20pm, got in the drive thru line. They took our order, and we waited like 30 minutes to get to the window. When we get to the window,  we get asked if what must have been the order of the person behind us was ours. 

They ""forgot"" to put our order in when we gave it at the speaker. So we give them the order again, and they give us the total, no offer of a discount for their screw-up, and we pay. Wait 10-15 minutes for the food, and head home. Get home and discover they didn't put the 3 piece shrimp we ordered in the bag.

"Drive-in's are freaking COOL. Hubby and I were craving burgers during out jaunt into Cherry Hill (apartment hunting and whatnot), and Yelp led us to this place. 

After getting lost for a few minutes, we made it, pulled in, and were quickly approached by a friendly waitress. We said we had never been there before and she gave us a quick rundown on how to order: lights on for service, roll down your window, and they hook a tray over with your food. Simple enough.

We ordered two cheeseburgers, cheese fries, a root beer, and diet lemonade (no diet Coke, but their lemonade was really good). It's supposed to mimic a old school drive-in, so the burgers were old school sizes. Read: not that large. Nonetheless, the burger, fries, and drink were enough to fill me up. 

Prices are cheap, and service is fast and super friendly My one gripe, aside from the lack of diet Coke, is that the cheese kind of tastes funny...like it came from a can or something. Also, they don't give you much of it (which I guess can be a good thing).

"I'm not some connoisseur of cheese steaks, but I've had enough to know that it shouldn't be 100% bland.  Yes, it was the ""best"" cheesesteak I've had, but I had to sprinkle S&P across my sandwich before it actually tasted ""good"".  With that said, cheesesteaks aren't the kind of food that would blow my taste buds out of the water, so I'd give it a 3.5/5 stars for over all taste and quality.

Now, lets talk about service:
To say the service we rec'd was subpar would be an overstatement.   I'm a paying customer. This may not be the Ritz-Carlton, but treat me with a little respect.  Further, this is my first time here and there are no ""rules"" on ""how to properly place an order"" posted, so please don't chastise me for not knowing how to give you my order.  The people working here are rude, incompetent and not happy.    

Other random thoughts:
1. CASH ONLY?! Really?? Really?? This isn't some traveling hot dog stand or food truck.  We're in the 21st century - get with the times.  There's really no valid excuse why an establishment can't take cards.
2.  The place is filthy. Filthy.  Seriously - there were probably like 10 health code violations taking place while we were there and I can't believe no one has reported them for being so unsanitary.
3.  What's with the gang signs plastered all over the bathroom?! 

Service and random thoughts combined: I'd give them 1.5 stars.

"I stumbled upon this corner Vietnamese restaurant on a Monday and I was thinking of one thing: vermicelli noodles! 

I analyzed the menu to see if there were something else that caught my eye, but I was pretty much set with ordering bun thit nuong (vermicelli noodles and grilled pork), goi cuon (Vietnamese spring rolls), and cafe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee) for esophageal lubrication. As a previous Yelper had stated, the peanut sauce the comes with the spring rolls was divine and one of these days I'll force the bf to make me some! My noodles came in a clear bowl which I thought was odd, but didn't hinder the taste and my iced coffee was made to perfection.

"Acme Oyster House is HANDS DOWN one of the top 5 places I was able to eat at while in New Orleans! 

You wait outside in line to get seated, and if you're lucky, you'll wait less than 30 minutes. The tantalizing scent of cheesy, buttery, charbroiled oyster wafts out as soon as someone opens the door to grab the next party. On a Sunday slightly after lunchtime, our party of three was able to get seated in around 30 minutes.

I ordered a dozen charbroiled oysters, and a bread pudding for dessert! My two pals got the Taste of New Orleans, a crab cake, and the meat pies. 

If you like seafood like I do, and can't resist anything cheesy, you'll LOVE the charbroiled oysters! The bread and the saltines helped to sop up all the juices. I pretty much licked each shell clean, and I was so tempted to get another half dozen! 

The bread pudding was also spectacular! I added a scoop of ice cream to help mellow out the warm and caramelized taste of the bread pudding, and my friends all loved it as well. 

Some people love pizzas and poboys for their hangover foods, but I think what I had at Acme would truly hit the spot if I were hungover after a night of drinking on Bourbon Street!

I wasn't able to try any of the other oyster houses in NOLA, but all the positive Yelp reviews were correct when they said that Acme was the cream of the crop.",2,1.0,5.0,0.0008049011,4.65625,0.0055236816,4.53125,1.5124679e-06,3.703125,1.563194e-12,3.8125,0.98046875,4.96875,0.59375,3.390625

"No dim sum cart here but its ok. Take a look at what you want on that order form, check it off and hand it to the server... The dim sums don't come out all at once.. Wait time is not that long in between so it's ok (or maybe we went early like when they opened). 
The items are slightly higher than the usual chinatown places, probably by a dollar or so. They start @ $4 and most of the items are around that range. We got the usual har kow (shrimp dumpling), pork siu mai, shrimp rice roll(wrapping wasn't thick, it was rolled out very evenly and thin so you get to the shrimp quicker!!) , beef ball and a number of other items. Everything was delicious, Tea is free in chinatown restaurants but it's about $1 a cup to $4 a pot of tea.

"I've now tried both of the local escape rooms in town. Took my boyfriend and another couple here for a double date on Valentine's weekend. It was all of our first times here but we've all done escape rooms elsewhere. We chose the Alien Escape because I've already done a pirate escape room at the Cube and was a little too scared to do the Dentist room. It seems from the website that there are 6 room choices, but only 3 offered at a time. I booked our visit online well in advance to be sure we'd get a time slot on a Saturday night before it filled up. When we arrived, we were greeted but had to wait about 30 minutes for the previous group to finish and then to reset it. They offered to let us switch to the Dentist room right away since it was empty, but I was set on the Alien room.

Four seemed to be the perfect group size for this room. Lots of teamwork puzzles that require a two people. There was even a jump scare! (On our way out, they showed us the footage of me getting scared, dropping everything, and running, which was hilarious). There was one puzzle that was so challenging it really stumped us and slowed down our progress. They were more than willing to give hints, I just wish we had asked sooner. 

With hints, we were able to escape with precisely 1 second to spare, although they did let us know that they allow groups to complete the rooms even if they don't meet the time limit. (Possibly why they were behind schedule). 

The quality of rooms compares really well to the other local spot as well as the customer service, although the time limit is shorter and the price is a bit higher.

Our server was friendly and attentive.
This menu is a gastro-dream for me.  The Steak Tartare would compare with the best I've eaten in Europe or the US.  However, the generous portion (which makes it an exceptional value) puts it ahead of all others.  Couldn't pass up my favourite comfort food - Shepherds Pie.  Apart from the chef being a little heavy handed with the Rosemary, it was stellar.
I also tasted the duck bolognese and the triple-fried fries - all delish.
Wines by the glass were reasonably priced.

"The chef has more ambition than talent. The overly-long list of menu items resembles every #Chopped kitchen mystery basket that got chopped for being too ambitious and hiding the stars of the basket.  The service was great, the wine list is great, but the food.... sorry folks, unbelievably mediocre especially considering the price points.  Oh, and if you're doing tasting menus for vegetarians and omnivores, you should either do 3 or 5 tastings for each side of the degustation. Don't leave your vegetarian date watching you eat 2 additional courses while they wait for their finale.  

The decor is cute - what we could see of it. The place is incredibly dark unless you're lucky enough to be seated by windows - we weren't - otherwise you need your phone light to even read the darn menu, never mind see your date.

The best part of my meal was the chicken liver mousse pate.  Everything else had serious issues.  The pork belly was unevenly cooked on a bed of mush that was supposed to be rice and I had to wade past a lot of fat to get to it.  The chicken liver pate mousse was presented well and the flavor was off the charts, but the Melba toast passing as brioche was tiny and insufficient to the amount of pate. My duck was deep fried, so it was unevenly cooked and the fat not cooked properly.  My friend's veal scallopine was not scallopine - it was deep fried instead of gently sauteed - and resembled shoe leather.  His souse vide lobster was shy of lobster and the risotto a sticky mess he couldn't finish.

The best part of the meal was dessert.  The custard in the creme brulee was one of the best I've ever had, hands down.  If only the finishing line cook hadn't flamed the sugar to a deep, deep black, not-so-subtly hiding that with a sliced berry.

All in all, I am deeply disappointed - for an institution which routinely got #1 in Tampa, it was dark, with an unevenly cooked, overly-huge dinner menu, and not worth the price.

"I WOULD bump this up to 5 stars, but there is one thing about Red Pony that I do not like:  the atmosphere / ambiance.  It's a personal bother that you may be fine with, but to me there is nothing special about it.  Also, while the food was overall very good, we ordered wrong a few times.

APPS:  All of the appetizers sounded delicious, and very creative - I was tempted to try their Tempura Sushi, but instead we selected their Goat Cheese Flatbread (Flatbread topped with Goat Cheese, Arugula, Pancetta, Grilled Red Onion, and a Honey Drizzle).  It was good, but nothing that I couldn't whip up at home in 5 minutes, and the Pancetta was VERY tough - like a jerky.  I wish I had gone with the sushi.

ENTREES:  Their specials didn't sound all that appealing, so we went ahead and ordered off of the menu.  Per a suggestion from our boss who has amazing taste when it comes to food, my husband ordered the 
Hickory Fired Cowboy Ribeye Bone in topped with Chile Butter, with Red Potatoes and Melted Onions & Mushrooms.  He said it is in his top 3 steaks of all time.  He loved the flavor, and the portion was quite generous.  So generous he took half home!  The waitress and I had a chat about the menu, and I had it narrowed down between the 
Shrimp & Grits   (Apple Bacon and Green Onion, with Mushrooms and Wine over Garlic Cheese Grits) OR... the 
Wood Grilled Beef Tenderloin  (Blue Cheese-Sweet Corn Risotto and Grilled Asparagus with Lemon Butter).  Per her suggestion, I went with the Tenderloin.  It was VERY tasty.  I really enjoyed the smokiness and tenderness of the meat, and the risotto was very tasty.  The asparagus was hit or miss per stalk.  We also got a side of Creamed Spinach (we heard about it with one of their specials) and since it was my husband's birthday, and he loves creamed spinach, I ordered it.  Weird.  No cream.  Just sauteed spinach with something in it, and it was VERY spicy.  Don't order this if you like traditional, cheesy spinach - or don't like spice.  

(My husband and I always have an ""ordering war"" and at Red Pony, he won for sure.  The flavor of his steak totally beat mine.)  

DESSERT:  We ordered the Chocolate Demise (Just Baked for a Minute Chocolate Cake Over Brownie Chunks with Vanilla Ice Cream).  This sounds better than it actually was.  It was basically just a lava cake - and there were no brownie chunks really, with a teeny tiny little side of ice cream.  You know how you sometimes get a side of ketchup in a little bowl with your fries?  It was smaller than that.  Sad.  Again, I wish we had gone with another selection, like the Top Notch Creme Brulee.  

On a previous visit, we only had cocktails, and they rocked.  I particularly enjoyed the White Grape Lemon Drop, and all of the dessert martini's.  :)",2,0.2578125,3.078125,0.23046875,3.0625,0.92578125,2.671875,0.26171875,3.078125,0.23144531,3.0625,0.25976562,3.09375,0.24609375,3.078125

If it is beef it is GREAT!  My wife and I both had the Prime Rib.  It was a real treat for us because it has a Cajun style rub and a wonderful horseradish
Cream that came with it.  We had 3 different sides and all were perfect.  The mushrooms were over the top good.

We had a great bottle of wine and followed our meal with a fantastic desert. The bread pudding will bring a tear to a glass eye!

Took my bf here for his birthday, it was delicious and beautiful from the start! We started with martinis, yum. The service was fabulous as well.

The most fun part about Barclay Prime is choosing which knife you want to use with your steak. You feel very special and like a VIP being presented with beautiful options. I had the filet which was perfect. Ended the night with complimentary sweets for the bf's birthday which was super nice.

"This review is for the valet parking attendant tonight (11/17/2015). My mother and I are from out of town on vacation and had a very long day. We came to the wharf originally to eat at a restaurant at the end of the wharf, but decided we didn't like the environment as there were no tables and only bar areas. We decided we would try this restaurant instead. Coming from the end of the wharf I mistakenly turned into your valet parking area thinking it was regular parking for this restaurant. As I turn into the lot your valet parking attendant pulled in front of me in another car put his hand out for me to stop and motioned for me to roll the window down. I rolled down my window and he rudely began to speak to me, telling me that ""This is valet you know, where I park your car for you. You need to turn around and go out the same way you came in."" I am a tourist, I am not from here. Coming from the other end of the wharf I did not see a valet parking sign as it was facing the other way. The attendant spoke to me so rudely. He said everything super slow as if I couldn't comprehend and he had an agitated look on his face the whole time. People make mistakes, he could have let me know in a nicer and more pleasant way and maybe I would have stayed and ate. Instead I left because the valet attendant was so rude to me I began to get angry and lost my appetite.

"This has really been a disappointment. I frequent Port of Subs more than any other sandwich shop in Reno, but this location has really got me reconsidering my preference. It seems that every time I go in there, whether there's a big line or not, it just takes forever. Until today, the wasted time was my only complaint.

I ordered a small #6 online and waited the allotted 30 minutes to go pick it up. Upon arriving, my sandwich was ready to go on the counter. When the guy went to ring it up, apparently the computer suddenly malfunctioned. Fine, technical difficulties. I get it. And so they went, calling multiple managers to try to figure out how to fix the register/computer.

I went to sit down at the bench seat near one of the tables to wait. When I sat down, the bench cushion fell through the framework of the bench and I fell down, hurting my finger. These kinds of things could be avoided by making sure your furniture is you know, not broken.

So I waited. And waited. Then another customer came in and ordered a sandwich. Then another customer came in and ordered three sandwiches. All the while, the employee was desperately trying to fix the register to no avail. I'm still waiting. Now, the really upsetting part occurred. When they finished making the two other customers' sandwiches, they simply walked over to the other register and rung them up there, BEFORE ME. Um, was that not an option when I needed to pay for MY stuff? At this point I've been waiting literally 25 minutes for a sandwich that I ordered ONLINE so I wouldn't have to wait (because I was on a lunch break). Finally, after both other customers had paid and left, I was given a ""sorry about the wait"" and charged full price for my sandwich. I don't expect free stuff but come on, I literally just waited nearly my entire lunch break for a sandwich that was already made when I walked in the door.

I left, speeding in order to get back to work in time. Just when I thought the shenanigans were over, I opened the wrapper and my sandwich was missing tomatoes. This was the icing on the cake.

"Another wonderful time at Your Pizza Shop. Six of us went to the 30th Anniversary fundraiser sponsored by Jenny and Jay. We enjoyed a early lunch first. I had the Italian Antipasta which was good a usual. Crisp lettuce, fresh tomato wedges, and an assortment of fresh meats and cheese.  The others had the famous Fried Chicken with Jojo potatoes and coleslaw. No disappointment there. The garlic knots were tasty as always. John, our server, provided spot on service and was pleasant as always. 

The Christmas tree was beautiful. The fish are enjoying their Festive tank too.

We went outside and joined the festivities.  We celebrated Mark Weber's Your Pizza Shop 30 YEARS of business on Saturday. He is very appreciative of the loyal support from his customers. Lots of great food was prepared by Chef Jason and Jen. There was salad, Chicken Piccata, macaroni & cheese, prime rib and mussels plus more.
 
Lea Braun entertained with her variety of songs.  She has a lovely voice. There were giveaways, raffles and fun for all!

in the spirit of the season, Mark, Jen and Jay also incorporated a benefit for Metropolitan Ministries. Without hesitation, Mark joined in with Jen and Jay to giving back to the community that has supported Your Pizza Shop for 30 years. Their goal is simple, you cannot save the world but if we put a bit of effort in there will be a lot less people going hungry and a lot fewer children waking up on Christmas morning without a present under the tree.

As customers, we all showed our support by donating toys and non-perishable food. It was epic.

"After several experiences at Treno, it can be variable depending on the time of day, who your server is, etc.

The bartenders are nothing to write home about and seem to be more interested in chatting with each other than engaging the customer and giving good service.
Sometimes the wineglasses smell like chlorine.  They must use too many chemicals in the dishwashers or something.
Hostesses should almost all be replaced by mature, accommodating older women than the young scantilly-clad teens who also seem to be more interested in chatting with each other.
Service can be good, or slow- you may get totally forgotten for 10-15 minutes, or have a full wine glass waiting just as you take your last sip- depends on who waits on you.
Management here is actually very good it seems, besides the minor hiccups with the service staff.
The food is almost always good, the pizza is well done, the salads are great, and the pastas are very nice as well- the meat sauce is particularly good.

With all of the minor qualms of Treno me and my parents still come here once a week so it's definitely worth a visit.

"So this was the first time I've been at Vedge for a friend's birthday dinner. The food was world class but the service was outright rude to say the least. Our party came at different times and we wanted to wait for everyone to arrive before ordering. After 20 mins our waiter told us there is another reservation coming at 930 for our table then walked away. This made me feel like a devalued customer before I even ordered. Did not understand why he had to rush us since there were multiple tables open during the entire time we were there. The food came out really fast and again we all felt rush eating it. We then ordered a desert with a candle for my friend's birthday which we had to remind him to bring out. Once he brought it out we then had to wait an additional 5 mins for him to remember spoons for everyone. 5 mins isn't long to wait but there was ice cream on the plate! Then he brought the check over and charged us a 20% gertuity which I did not think he deserved. But I was forced to give it but that point. Though our party was not 8 people. Super disappointing with the service tonight and I will not return because of how we were treated.

But recently, I was there with a friend, my husband, and my 2 year old son. I had to review the great service we had. Darryl went above and beyond for us. I didn't have a kids menu so I asked if they had fries. I hadn't been there in a while and I have never ordered fries at a Mexican restaurant, but that's what the kid asked for so I figured it couldn't hurt to ask. No, they don't, but that's ok. We ordered our drinks and everyone was still deciding on food. 

A few minutes later, our server returned with a to go order of fries from Tom's (next door) for our table. We were so surprised! I could not believe that our waiter would go next door to purchase French fries for my kid.

"We came by on a rainy Sunday for brunch. After putting our names down, we got a recommendation for coffee down the street while we waited (Vola) and when we returned about 25 minutes later, our table was ready as soon as we walked in! We decided on the special French toast (pineapple-coconut, a twice yearly option) and the South Philly Brekky bowl (eggs with Italian sausage and broccoli rabe, onions, etc on tots). The wait for food was a little longer than our wait for the table, but when you have your person to wait with, and a coffee to tide you over, you marvel at the small operation's ability to serve 9 tables more than you get annoyed/hangry. Finally the food arrived. The egg bowl was decent but our mutual favorite was the French toast. Boyfriend usually doesn't like coconut but he cleaned up the plate as well as I did, saying that the flavors were balanced and the flaked coconut was soft and delicious. Meanwhile, I contemplated buying a small slow cooker so I too could cook pineapple for French toast! This is a special that could happily return a little more often!

The decor and lay out of the place is pretty nice, but that's about it.
I thought the food was so gross, and nothing is labeled so you don't really know what anything is for the most part and then having to pay 20 bucks for something that was disgusting wasn't too great.

"The food is acceptable; it's different than what other businesses are offering. Sometimes the portions are so large and/or ""over sauced"" that flavor and texture of the food declines. That said, be aware that they'll also over charge. It occurred to me today. I said that I essentially wanted a ""High Tide"" minus some ingredients, including some meat. I was still charged for a high tide. After some back and forth, I was told to just get the ingredients of a high tide, but don't mention the dishes name and I won't be charged so much. After that, the employee refused to respond. It was a willful choice to overcharge me.

Service was very quick once we got our order in-the couple in front of us were entirely too long on the ordering, held the line up for 10 unreasonable minutes and the staff couldn't seem to get the line moving.  Dining area was clean, staff was friendly and in over abundance.  Wait what?  Well there were so many staff, they were underfoot in the line area.

Since I can't have gluten, I typically can't have flavored vodkas, but this is made with real fruit and so delicious! That drink was AMAZING!!!! My other half had a local IPA with no complaints.  We started with the meat plate and it was great! We loved the Sausage-ish pate.  The fig dip was terrific as well.  We then ordered the trout and the pork chop.  Both were fantastic.  The sides were so tasty that came with the trout and I ordered a side, but that was 2 drinks in, so my memory is slightly foggy! Haha!  None of the desserts were gluten free, so our awesome server had the kitchen make chocolate Buckeyes with whipped cream and also brought out a Whisper Creek cream on the rocks that is also made locally.  He even made sure I could drink it since gluten is in so many random things.  Needless to say, this was a fabulous experience!  Our server was so thoughtful and kind and our food was outstanding!!!!

"Yesterday, we had the displeasure of shopping at this Bulk Nation. For those that don't know, this place sells nuts, flour, spices, candy, and various similar products in bulk. We were sorely disappointed in the whole experience and will not be returning.

We got 7 bags in total containing cashews, sesame seed sticks, sriracha peas, dried cherry, coconut squares, etc. The coconut squares tasted stale. The sriracha peas barely had any heat. The bin containing dried mango had 2-3 stale looking pieces of mango. 

**WARNING** the scale by the bins tell you a lower weight than the scale at the counter. Before checking out, we placed our 7 bags on the needle scale by the bins and it said 2 lbs. After leaving the store, we added up the weight shown on the receipt and that added to over 3 lbs! That is 1 lb over what we thought it should have been.

The second big turn-off was the cashier telling us over and over again that if we spent $2 more then our total would be $20 and we would get a punch-card that would give us some small discount after 10 visits. We did not care for the punch-card so we refused. While the cashier was checking us out, I pulled out a coupon from the store's website but the cashier loudly said ""the sale has gone through...sorry we can't accept coupon."" You would think that if the cashier would spend so much time upselling their punch-card program that they would have the sense to tell us about the coupons on their website. Any other store would have gladly adjusted the price if they wanted return customers. This was clearly a lack of common sense customer service.

"FOOD: sweetgreen salads are the only kind that actually make me full! You can ask for two pieces of their buckwheat bread for free, which I now do on principle because they're so dang good and pair so well. 

PRICE: Discouraging. I always get a custom bowl because their signature ones are $10+, but as soon as you add any kind of protein it's $2 - $4 extra and the price difference is negligible. That being said, they have a fantastic selection of filling vegetables that come with the 4 toppings included, like sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and spicy broccoli. 

CONVENIENCE: Definitely one of the first places that comes to mind when guaranteed healthiness is a factor in dinner. (I *always* ask for this place if I want to weasle out a dinner with my fittest friends and they always say yes, but a lot of my friends turn out to be surprisingly big fans of this place! So as a crowd-pleaser/""where should do you want to get dinner/I don't care how about you/I don't care either"" place it's very helpful that it exists). And if you come before the rush times, you can zip in and out without a problem, and sweetgreen bowls and utensils are made from sturdy, earth-friendly materials that don't feel plastic and cheap like most takeout, and so taking out from sweetgreen still feels like a curated experience even though you're eating a salad from a to-go container at home. 

Some perennial downsides: service can be kind of blah, depending on who you get and what kind of a day they're having. The noise level is not great for a meal well shared or for conversation, and the lines that go out the door at 7pm make it unbearably crowded.

"I wish i could give negative stars. This McDonald's is the closest to my house so unless I'm anywhere else, this is the one I go  to. Went here a few nights ago. Ordered a meal with light salt on my fries and no ice in my drink and a sundae. Easy right? Nope. I got fries loaded with salt and ice in my drink. They gave me a sundae with no spoon or peanuts (which we all know just comes with the sundae). I asked several times for ketchup but was ignored. It wasn't until I was halfway home that I realized they also hadn't given me a straw. Will NEVER come back here again.

The servers definitely don't care about you. The just do their job. Not particularly friendly or excited.

The iced chai was watery tasting. At $3.40 you better taste better or give me more than Starbucks. Metro did neither.  So i'll stick with beloved Starbucks. 

The baked goods look delicious, but at $2+ each, they're pretty pricey for mediocre to small sizes. My biscotti was too hard and stale. I prefer crunch on the outside, slight chew on the inside. For $1.75 I felt ripped off. 

Also, while they're going for the cute ""open bakery"" look, cover your stuff please. There were flies ALL OVER. 

The breakfast burrito, at $7, was pretty tasty. But nothing to rave about. And it took about 15 min to make. Really? Seriously?

"I know there's a huge Hudson vs Hamilton thing. For me, there is only Hamilton. I've been coming here since I was a wee lass. As a youngin' I didn't even LIKE pizza (I've come a long way baby) and the wonderful guy in the kitchen (I swear it's the same one who still works there) used to make me a grilled cheese on a hoagie roll that he stuck in the pizza oven. :) I believe they served sandwiches as well as tomato pie back in those days (the early 80s if you must know) so they had the fixins.

Nowadays, they're strictly tomato pie. If you're the best at something why even attempt to make anything else? First of all, when you walk in, the smell is enough to make you weak in the knees and let you know the treat you're in for. The pizza comes out piping hot with just enough gooey cheese. The sauce is savory with lots of black pepper which I really like. The crust is thin and comes with plenty of yummy, crunchy air bubbles that I always call dibs on.

Up until a few months ago I'd only ever had the plain pie but I've recently tried the pepperoni. Great pepperoni but I'm a plain girl all the way. I don't like anything messing with the flavors.

The wait can be really long on Fridays and Saturdays but they've recently added a (heated) waiting room next door with a TV. I'm surprised the TV is still there giving the unlocked waiting room they keep it in and the neighborhood but there you are. I suppose it's good to have the room for winter but I wouldn't use it in the warmer months. Part of the experience is waiting on the concrete benches and breaking out the BYOB wine you brought with you while you wait for your table. Jersey's best pizza, hands down. Go!

"There's nothing better than enjoying the game with your friends at a sports bar.  Yeah, going to the actual game is pretty fun too - but as we all know it can be fairly prohibitive with ticket costs and $9 stadium beers.  But what if the game came to the sports bar?  Welcome to the Colts Grille.

I first went to the Colts Grille during the 2012 NFL Playoffs; the place was packed and buzzing with grid-iron excitement.  Some family from New England (and die-hard Pats fans) were with us, so I my hopes for a great experience were especially high.  You know when you walk in that you're in a hard-core football establishment - the waiting-area is draped with some awesome Colts memorabilia and team collectibles.  We were seated and I was awe-struck with the amount of t.v. screens - you literally don't have to turn your head more than 30 degrees to watch any game, with mini screens in each booth.  Awesome. You also get the sense like you're sitting in a stadium suite; there are even private party rooms that really do look like a club box, with all the modern conveniences you need to enjoy the broadcast in style.

Can you say hometown Indiana pride?  The Colts Grille sources a lot of Hoosier-based food and local craft brewery options.  That's a two-point conversion in my playbook.  We got our orders in before kickoff - started with some appetizers and a bucket of long-necks; the prosciutto, artichoke and spinach dip was on-point and you can never go wrong with the chips and salsa.  I also ordered the Farmer's Market Steak Salad - a generous portion of NY Strip over a bead of leafy greens, house dressing, and a fried egg.  Pretty sure this is one of the best salads ever...  The service was also great, really prompt servers always there to help us keep the drinks coming.

Once the game got going, the place started to amp up.  We were watching the game that was broadcast over the restaurant and every time there was a touchdown, the music blasted and the party lights got going - everyone was into it, like we were actually at the game!  They even have hide-away glass in the men's bathroom so you can see the screens when hitting the head after a few buckets, so don't miss a fantasy-crazed minute.  Fun trivia games also keep you entertained during commercials and half-time.

I like going to the game just as much as the next fan, but when you can bring the game to a sports bar with excellent food, drinks, and service like the Colts Grille, it makes it awful tough to decide.  My family from NE were really impressed, especially since they wanted to enjoy the game and were looking for a taste of local Indianapolis culture.  Did I already use a two-point conversion reference?  This is one of the best places to watch the game in Indy.

"This kind of sets the standard for what I consider to be an awesome hookah place in a strange new city. We rolled in around 10pm on Sunday, knowing from the Yelp app full-well that they were going to close at 11pm. So we get seated and get right to it - we want the tequila sunrise hookah because that name just sounds awesome. 

The decoration is legit & authentic. The walls are covered with cloth, the windows are blacked out from the street with the same cloth, there are the cloth hangings coming off the wall, and the lighting is dim to make it seem authentic, something straight out of one thousand and one nights. The tables are round and are organized in a lavish lounge sort of setting. The waiter guy was nice, friendly, and was doing a rockstar job of checking in on us and the coals.

Hookah for three people came out to $27. Not exactly cheap, but at least not exorbitant compared to some hookah places across the country I have unfortunately visited.  

My return visit scheduled and on the books has already incorporated this place into the itinerary. I look forward to trying the food.

The server brought out multiple ""surprise plates"" to hand out, and asked if anybody liked spicy food-- ME ME ME!! I ended up getting whitefish steamed in a foil pouch with a spicy tomato relish on top, roasted brisket with hot peppers, and a delicious corn tamale with banana cream sauce. My fellow diners got equally yummy selections, and we all walked away full and happy.

"Best gyros on Indy's north side can be found at Petra Cafe located on 86th just off Keystone. You can order on line, phone or walk in.  The menu includes an assortment of popular Greek sandwiches, salads and soups and smoothies. 

We enjoyed carry-out Gyro combos for lunch. The gyros were carefully wrapped in blue checked paper - so Greek. The meat and fillings were generous and delicious. The fries were crispy with a great spicy coating. Combos come with sandwich, fries and a drink for $8.95. 

We also enjoyed a maza plate for $10.95. The plate offered a flavorful baba ghanouj, hummus, felafel and green salad. They also provided 2 large pita breads to accompany the plate.  Wow, so much delicious food. Very, very good. The maza plate easily feeds four.   

The staff was friendly and included extra tzatziki for the sandwiches. The order was accurate and food hot. The ingredients are high quality and fresh. Portions were generous.

"Tucked away a cute little women owned brewery. They have a gastropub but this is just a taproom with some Thai inspired food options. 

Scarlet lane is a vibe. Horror. Creepy. 

They play old scary movies on the TVs and play slightly 80s vibe thriller songs. Inside you'll find murals on the walls of red/black trees and a giant statue of a devil wearing a scarf that says ""Scarlet Lane."" 

We got the Asian snack mix, lots of pretzels. Pork steam buns and a pork bahn mi. The bahn mi was tasty on a fresh baguette, just a bit too much bread that made it a little dry for my taste. 

The star of the show was the steamed buns! The sauce and pork was cooked perfectly. I'll dream about those tonight. Hello carry out in 2 days!

"We recently placed a take-out order at White Yak after reading rave reviews on Google and Yelp. Having grown up in a household where eating Nepalese food was extremely common, I was really excited to try this hidden gem in Philly. But sadly I ended up with mixed feelings about this place.

 For our appetizers, we ordered Sha Palay ( Semi-circular shaped deep fried bread stuffed with seasoned beef) and Pan- fried Vegetarian Momo Combo ( Vegeterian Dumplings that included 3 potato, 3 cauliflower and 3 vegetable type). For our main-course, we ordered a Beef Shatrak ( Sauted beef with bell peppers, bok-choy, onions and other aromatics) and a Vegetarian Shatrak ( Sauted soy bean beef with bell peppers, bok-choy, onions and other aromatics). And for our side, we decided to order Tingmo (Tibetan Steamed Buns). 

This was my fiancé's first time trying Nepalese/Tibetan cuisine and he was absolutely blown away by the meal. According to him, the Sha Palay was perfection and should be a must order on anyone's list. The Beef Shatrak was extremely delicious and had copious amounts of beef and veggies. He would rate the meal a 5/5. 

Unfortunately, I can't say the same for my meal. Being a vegetarian I decided to order the Vegetarian Shatrak and found it to be rather bland. The momos were okay but were nothing memorable. I however would definitely avoid the potato momo. The Tingmo on the other hand was soft and fluffy and we would definitely recommend placing an order of that. Overall, I would rate the meal a 3/5. 

Besides that, White Yak is environmentally conscious and uses paper boxes instead of plastic containers which is great! They also gave us complimentary miso soup, which was really nice of them. And lastly, the food they served us was pipping hot and fresh. I think if you are new to Nepalese/ Tibetan cuisine, White Yak is a fantastic place to start your adventure. But, if you grew up eating this cuisine and are familiar with it, I would recommend you find a different eatery to get your fix.",2,1.0,2.640625,1.0,2.859375,0.115722656,3.53125,1.0,2.875,1.0,2.90625,1.0,2.765625,1.0,2.875

When I arrived the lights were on and the open LED was flashing, the door dash sign was flipped to the ""closed"" side. Door was unlocked so I proceeded inside.

"Decided to try Northside based on personal recommendations and the knowledge that it's a sister or offshoot of the Late Harvest Kitchen which is 'OUT - Freaking - STANDING.  Here, both the hostess and the waiter were friendly and efficient. 'Old School' soft drinks are a nice touch.  Patio had a very nice appearance and indoor dining was trendy and comfortable.  

Tami & I shared onion rings for an appetizer. A bountiful supply of crisp & flavorful rings served with a tasty remoulade looked and tasted 'appetizing'.  After downing a couple, Tami noted that she preferred a flakier coating or breading. These were battered and nicely fried to a golden brown - and, as we both noted, much too salty.  Though I finished them, the salt really crept up on me.  We both ordered the Carolina pulled pork and found it to be outrageously satisfying, both in taste and in portion size.  We both brought half of our meat home and are looking forward to lunch or a snack tomorrow.  The 'dry' preparation is ideal such that the diner can sauce to individual preference from the four containers delivered in a sauce caddy.  Tami had the Mac & Cheese, her signature fave, for both of her sides.  Though I liked the accompanying rib jam, she's not a big fan of sauces so only tasted it.  Her assessment of the preparation is that it was 'pretty basic' and not particularly flavorful-though mixing in jam as intended may be the reason.  And, Or But...Make no mistake about it, she's a Mac & Cheese aficionado.  I chose the fries with smoked marrow butter & jalapeño. Nicely crisped, rich and flavorful, especially with the spicy kick from the raw pepper slices.  Once again, however, I found the dish to be overly salted.   As others have indicated, the maple bourbon butter served with the corn bread is a real palate pleaser.  I did not find, as others have, that it made up for the dry, squatty crispy muffin of which I ate only half. 

In sum: I'm a huge fan of the pork and would get it again and again. That said, it's 90 minutes later and I'm still tasting the salt of the other items.  Gotta up their game with seasoning.  In fairness, the hostess asked for feedback - which we gave - showing a responsible interest in customer satisfaction.",1,0.115722656,2.921875,0.12207031,2.9375,0.016845703,3.484375,0.11767578,2.921875,0.115722656,2.890625,0.123046875,2.921875,0.12207031,2.90625

"I came to Flamestone  for the first time with my husband, two colleagues, and one of their spouses for a night out. We had a reservation at 4:45 on a Saturday. The service was so slow from the start. We ordered drinks, and it seemed to take quite an excessive amount of time to get them and to order appetizers. We had the table side guacamole,  I thought it was very good. After the apps were gone, we finally ordered food, maybe 30-40 minutes after arrival. Our server failed to give prices for specials, a surprise I got later. I ordered a special of steak with spicy Tomatillo sauce and shrimp over mashed potatoes. The meal was amazing. I mean, amazinggggg. Had our service not been average,  I would have given 5 stars. After dinner,  we had desert, which was carrot cake for my spouse and fried oreos for me. Again, amazing. Drinks were good,  but the server walked off with me trying to order one in mid-sentence twice. Overall, we were there nearly three hours for one meal,  leaving at 7:40. The server ran our cards then snatched the signed receipts while we were still sitting at the table- a first for me. Believe me, I was ready to leave also, but he could have gotten in a bigger hurry at any point over the 3 hours. My end vote- food is a solid 5, but the service lowered the overall experience.",1,1.0,5.0,4.725109e-13,3.78125,8.046627e-06,3.375,1.0,1.984375,1.877197e-09,2.578125,0.65625,5.0,1.0,1.0625

I got a hand full of diced potatoes they call home fries and of my 2 eggs one was barely cooked so the middle was still clear, also the hollandaise sauce had so much melted butter it was separating on the plate. It did not look appetizing and did not taste appetizing. They don't use Canadian Bacon but some sort of ham that's just like lunch meat and they charge $13 for the honor. My girl got a crab cake. The fries were decent but whatever they put in the crab cake was sweet, sweet is not a good flavor for crab. The coleslaw was dry, essentially just diced cabbage and had craisins for some reason.

They were out of many food items which is shocking for a mid week brunch meal at 12pm.

My friend ordered a chicken shawarma and was highly disappointed in the meal because the chicken was tough and lacking any seasoning. The pita bread tasted as if it was previously frozen and recently thawed... it was not warm and did not have any flavor. 

We added hummus which was extremely chunky, hard, dry, and again without flavor. The hummus seemed to be left over from the previous night.

""""" Worst Calzone and Worst Beef Sandwich Ever!!! """"
So I grew up with Rosati's Pizza. Seriously!  I was born and raised in Chicago, home of the best pizza and best Italian Beefs in the world!  After 36 years up north our entire family moved from the far NW Suburbs of Chicago to FL. My favorite pizza is pan style and for those who have tried it, Rosati's doesn't even come close to a true tasting authentic pan style pizza so I always order thin crust from Rosati's. 
So single star is really because of their service and from our (first time) non-pizza order. So I order a Calzone with Mushrooms and Ricotta Cheese. I've never had their Calzone, pizza yes, but not anything else and wish I didn't because it was awful!  Just awful!Not only bad, my Calzone had the wrong ingredients. After I get home I find a pepperoni and mozzarella cheese Calzone in the box. So I made a phone call just to let them know, hey, I brought home a Pepperoni and not my Mushroom and Ricotta so maybe you mixed an order up, so check if there's a Calzone being picked up and they don't get the wrong one too. And, to again let you know I got the wrong one.  Now I know who I'm talking to, it's a ride front desk clerk with green dyed hair the same who took my payment who was probably 15 or 16 and just didn't have all her marbles. So she says, ""ok"".   I'm like, ok, can I speak to the manager please. So Nina (the Rosatis Manager) answers and I had to explain again that I got the wrong order. I picked my order up (order #60) about 20 minutes ago and I got the wrong Calzone. Nina's answers with ""ok"".  And that's all she says. I was like omg!  Not even an apology for screwing up my dinner or how my taste buds were destroyed as pepperoni is a far cry from my expected delicious mushroom and ricotta, and does Nina have any clue about Management, plus I've way overpaid for this lousy pepperoni! I ask her are you not even going to say we're sorry for messing up your order?  She answers, well that'll happen. 
That was it. Oh, and by the picture you can tell how way undercooked it was. The inside dough was still gooey.  I'm willing to bet they last about another 6-12 months.

"I rarely listen to Yelp reviews and reserve judgement until I actually go to the place.  I hear too many people missing out on something good (or decent) based on something they read.  REALLY?

First off,  let me start by saying that this place is not nearly as bad as the reviews are saying.  I know my Asian food  (simply because I am Asian), and this place is on par with the bigger Asian Mega-Buffets in the STL Metro Area  (Emperors Palace, Hokkaido, etc.).  Some items at Tokyo Seafood Buffet are even BETTER than these other places.  Also remember - this is a BUFFET. Don't expect a 4 or 5 star gourmet experience.  It's good though.

I went during Sunday Brunch hours.  This place is HUGE.  There is sushi on a conveyor belt (the only one in STL, I believe) and a sushi ""chef"" right there making the stuff,  a Hibachi Grill with a Hibachi Chef, a huge buffet spread  (with Chinese, Dim Sum, a ton of seafood (including raw oysters, shrimp, crawfish, mussels, clams), some non-Asian food (American/Mexican), desserts (even with a separate freezer for ice cream products, a chocolate fountain, etc.)).  

What I found was that there really was no order to the food  (e.g. right next to the Lo Mein were soft chicken tacos.. haha).  Also, every mega-Asian buffet seems to have Mac N Cheese.  Mac N Cheese has been AWFUL at the other places...but somehow Tokyo Seafood Buffet's was tasty and decent!  Of course, we are not going there for Mac N Cheese, but if you're going to have it in your buffet... at least make it edible.

The sushi is not nearly as bad as people made it out to be.  Of course, maybe it depends when you go.  I'm guessing Sunday brunch times would have more variety.  Some people were saying there wasn't much variety  (a couple of choices).  That's inaccurate. There were several choices, and I found some of the rolls to be very tasty!  They certainly are better than Supermarket sushi  (which I do enjoy), and even better than some of the well-known sushi places around town.  Sure, the choices are limited - but there's certainly more than just ""a couple"" of choices than what some reviewers claimed.  

For less than $15/person, this is TOTALLY worth the money.  The complaints here are a little harsh compared to what I experienced.  One thing I would like to do is order off the menu sometime instead of getting the buffet.  I also would like to visit outside of Sunday Brunch hours.

Will I go back?  Absolutely.  I encourage people to visit places even if they have bad reviews.  Think for yourself.  Don't rely on others.  This place is still new, so give them a chance.

"My wife ordered from this restaurant twice now, the first time she ordered a burrito bowl with rice. We got a bowl with chicken, beans, and cheese, and a note that said sorry out of califlower rice, but please come again. We contacted the delivery service for a refund but they can only offer 25% refund, was told an email has to be sent to their customer service for a refund as they have no phone contact and it would be 1 to 3 days. Ordered again, this time with rice on the side. Got charged for the burrito bowl and the rice, get the delivery and the bowl with chicken, beans,  and cheese is in there, but again no rice, no note, just a charge for it. So now we are back to square one, again.

"This place is great - if you come on a good day. 

I love sitting outside - it reminds me of the secret garden. So gorgeous and peaceful for being on Plumb Ln in Reno. 

Last visit was meh - waiting with 8 other guests at the hostess stand for even an acknowledgement by the bar staff was about 5 minutes. Other servers and kitchen staff passed by us several times, causing me to constantly move out of the way since there were so many of us waiting for seating or even just a quick, ""we'll be right with you."" So once we were finally greeted we asked to be seated outside, because there's people drinking wine outside RIGHT NOW, clearly you're seating outside. I was shut down instantly with, ""we're not seating outside, do you still want to stay."" Uh ya, I want to stay, I waited 10 minutes to be greeted - we can sit at the bar no biggie :)

Bar tenders just seemed unhappy to be there -- of course, it's 3pm on a Sunday, I'd be unhappy to be working too. So we'll give them that. I ordered a bloody mary, out of it, I ordered French toast, out of it, I ordered fish and chips, ok we're not out of that. 

Fish & Chips - Staple. Not much too it, so I was really pleased with their fries. The batter on the fish was cold, soggy, and way too sweet. I brought it home thinking, I'll reheat and try again, nope. My boyfriend confirmed, ""it's really not good."" I try everything twice before I make a firm decision - cardinal rule of foodie-ism - but something just makes me not want to even waste the time or money. 

Southwest Chicken Burger - My lunch date had this and loved it - after she got her ranch (which she had to ask 4x for).  Brought one home for my boyfriend. He liked it. Spicy and different twist with the whole peppers on it. Very New Mexico style. A little awkward to eat, but what the heck that's what napkins are for right? 

Calamari - YUUUUMMMM. Perfect. No complaints. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. Tartar Sauce was on point. Maybe drinks breakfast and apps are their specialty.

Mimosa - Large is half of regular sized champagne class. YES THAT's HALF FULL/HALL EMPTY. Just get a small they put it in the same glass and give you same exact amount. Again, the bar tender wasn't very pleasant - my friend ended up with mostly orange juice. The couple next to use ordered a small and got the same thing we were charged for a large so there's that. 

BANANA RUM FRENCH TOAST -- DONT ASK JUST DO IT.

All in all - yess I'll be going back. NO I will not be sitting inside, ever again especially at the bar. BACON BLOODY MARYS and Jalepeno infused vodka - hell yes, you can keep your manners and I'll take my bacon flavored booze and banana rum French toast.",1,0.012329102,3.734375,0.013793945,3.71875,0.17871094,2.84375,0.014892578,3.734375,0.014282227,3.78125,0.014160156,3.71875,0.014526367,3.765625

My husband-to-be and I walked about a mile from our home in East Passyunk to discover this, but we made the best of it.

(It was still the same price -- it's annoying when restaurants make you pay for something you don't want, but whatever.) Without the meat there was really nothing on it -- a tiny bit of cheese and it looked like we had a half slice of tomato each. We left hungry.

The service wasn't great -- our server forgot our drink orders (we each ordered a draft beer) and had to ask us again what we wanted after we'd been waiting for about 15 minutes.

When I've had people visit me, brought people to Nashville, etc., this is the go-to place. Even though it's kind of awkward that such a great restaurant is housed in an old plantation. Not exactly a fan, there.

But the FOOD. Ohhh, the upscale Southern comfort food. If I were really rich and lived in Nashville like a country star in one of those crazy mansions in the hills, I would hire Martha to be my personal cook. I would eat this stuff every day: chicken croquettes with a mushroom sauce, grilled green beens, stone ground cheese grits, the plantation salad with melted brie and brown sugar, the fried chicken, their signature tea punch and mint juleps, the sweet potato pie dumplings...imagine a deep, rolling, Southern-accented ""Oh myy lorrrd."" It is all that good. The food here is made with heart, and you can taste it.

The service is attentive and friendly--none of my friends work there anymore, but they've managed to keep good servers in tow. =) 

If you are in Music City, you MUST make it out to Belle Meade to sample Martha's superior Southern cooking.",2,1.0,5.0,0.171875,4.40625,0.020751953,3.765625,1.0,5.0,1.0686563e-11,3.25,1.0,5.0,6.024493e-09,2.25

"We brought a friend here for his birthday.I won't be going back.I heard so much about Brazlian meat buffets for so long I was excited to finally have one near my home.
Not to sound snobbish but I want my lamb chop to taste like a lamb chop and the chicken to taste like chicken.
They must have one spice blend that every piece of meat is encrusted in.With everything drenched in the same seasoning as every other piece of meat , other than texture everything was similar tasting.
When I mentioned this to our waiter he said ""yeah people who don't like lamb are surprised that they like it here"" What they like is the fact they can't taste the lamb.
If I had to pick ,the sausage and filet mignon were the best.
It is very over priced and at $40.00 a piece before drinks or anything else you will run up your tab.
They tried to slip us bottled water when we said we would just have water.
It set the tone for the night when I promptly told our waiter we did not want nor did we ask for expensive bottled water. 
He must of thought we were cheap because he told us when he presented the check he added an 18 per tip to the bill, if it was ok? Very pushy for only 3 people at the table. It was his loss because I tip 20 per. or more.The next day we felt sick since we are not giant meat eaters.
I will not go back to this place but I would try again somewhere someone with a decent palate recommended.

"Apparently no one really knows, but I understand that the story of how Hot Chicken came to be goes a little something like this: Years ago, Thornton Prince III came home to his lady after a night of let's say, ""having relations."" The next morning, said lady served Thornton a nice fried chicken breakfast, revengefully loaded with an obscene amount of cayenne, garlic, and who knows what else. Instead of being unable to stomach the spicy chicken, Thornton actually liked it! So much in fact, that he decided to devote his life to perfecting the recipe, and the rest is history. Who knows if it's true, but it's a darn good story...

Which brings us to this wonderful Nashville dive, Prince's: where mild is hot enough to burn, cash is the only currency exchanged, sodas are available from the two vending machines next to the ordering window, someone is selling pie in the dining area, waiting for your food shouldn't surprise you, and that red grease will still leak through that brown paper bag even though you've got bread and French fries there underneath.

"A few tips for your visit to Bee Coffee Roasters' original location on Lafayette Road:

1.) Check in on the Yelp app to snag a deal
2.) parking is easy peasy with their lot (easier than downtown, that is)
3.) Need a drink to go? No problem. Beans for the road? They've got it!
4.) I'm personally a big fan of their menu concoctions that use local maple syrup (Shagadellic) and lavender syrups. 
5.) Small snacks available
6.) Fun, quiet spot for meetings - several tables available and one of the only local coffee joints I can think of in this neck of the woods (easy access from the highway as well)
7.) Note: this spot has a different feel from the downtown location. Think more laid back, less natural light and the coffeeshop from Friends.

I feel that they'd be better off reducing their prices, thus driving in more customers and generating a profit through that rather than the high profit margin system that they have in place currently. 

honesty though, they need to just get their system down first. how hard is it to cater to minor requests? substituting provolone instead of American or adding fries to a sandwich (oh and by the way, why am I paying extra for swapping something like this?!)? a side of ranch/hot sauce? come on, the customer shouldn't be responsible for making sure their requests are taken care of.

"Absolutely wonderful, I only give 4 stars instead of 5 because our steaks were not cooked properly. They were still delicious just not accurate. 

We had lobster bisque that was phenomenal. The bread was also fresh. Our server was very attentive. We both ordered filet and both said medium. My husbands was still mooing I swear but he did not wish to complain. My steak was good on one side but was more well done or charred on the other half. There were enough juices on my plate to sop up and make it not so dry. I did not complain because at that point i had eaten half of the steak and said it was great. My steak seemed like it was split in the center and once I got past the medium side it was overcooked. I still ate it and enjoyed it. 

I read other reviews prior to heading out and was a little leary of the reviews saying they had fat and gristle in their steak. I did not have a single bite of fat or gristle and neither did my husband. His steak was very rare and the plate was covered in blood. He will eat a rare steak so I was glad he got the mooing cow not me. 

He had broccoli au gratin and I had brussel sprouts. Both sides were awesome and plentiful. We could not even finish the sides they were so large. This is a good thing since everything is ala carte. 

I read reviews about the decor but I thought it was very clean and well kept. The wait staff was very professional and the helper kept my glass full. I even turned once to grab a drink of water and was surprised it had been filled again when I wasn't looking. Damn he is good lol. 

Overall, I say Ruth's Chris is a great treat. I was considering 3 stars since the steaks are 50 bucks and they should be cooked perfectly for that price but, the staff were so awesome that they deserve 4 stars on their own. I hope next time our steaks are perfect and I can give them 5 stars.",2,0.65625,4.375,0.76171875,4.15625,0.9140625,4.5,0.73828125,4.28125,0.8125,4.03125,0.640625,4.21875,0.66015625,4.1875

"Mini Doughnut Factory has a new fan. I got a box of 24 donuts to share with my friends... and got to the event with 12. If you have zero self control this might be your worst enemy/ best discovery. 

I first tried Mini Doughnut Factory at a Yelp Prohibits Prohibition event and their booth was the one I visited the most. I got in line at least 5x and ordered 3 donuts at a time. It has been getting A LOT of buzz on social networks and I see why. Not only are these donuts adorable but they are INCREDIBLE. Ranging from the Homer Simpson donut (pink icing with sprinkles) to strawberry cheesecake to snickers these donuts pack a lot of flavor in 1-2 bites. 

The Mini Doughnut Factory isn't afraid to try crazy combinations - AND THEY ALL WORK.

The restaurant wasn't super busy so we would've probably been fine without a reservation.

I would like to give a shout-out to our server Francesca because she made sure that I always had a full champagne flute of mimosa in front of me. 5/5 star service!

Unfortunately I can only give Herbie's 3 stars because we waited very, very long for our food. The drop biscuits looked a little burnt and were cold by the time they arrived at our table. The biscuits were still savory and you could really taste the cheddar and chive, but I was really looking forward to a soft, warm biscuit.

"Unappealing...
I had the Athenian Scallops with ""Greek Fries"" which I will get to later. First, the scallops were cooked at a close to perfect temp which I appreciate. The seasoning on the delicate scallops was a little heavy handed which I don't appreciate. All in all, I believe the scallops were not the issue. The rest of the meal fell flat. The orzo had the ""just water"" flavor that most untalented chefs use to cook with. I'm no professional, but finishing the orzo in olive oil, wine, some citrus (take your pick), or something to add flavor would have gone a long way. I also didn't get any parmesan unless it was hidden somewhere else. Maybe it was in the red pepper sauce which was less than pedestrian. Now to the ""Greek Fries."" I should have known better.

Buffet is decent if you get there close to 11am when they open. Otherwise it gets picked over very fast. Waiters and owner hover over you in a creepy way. If you leave any leftovers on your plate waiters give nasty looks. Read your receipt carefully I've been charged for extra items on multiple visits. If you don't catch it you have to take their word they've refunded your card because they won't give you a receipt. It also takes 3-7 days for the refund to show up.

"Yep, not a fan of Wal Mart.....just not sure I ever will be.  But, there are just some things you can't get at Target and don't want to spend the time or the money driving to Lowes for.  That's where the begrudgingly made trip to Wal Mart comes in.  I try and only do it every couple years.

The Plainfield store honestly is a bit better than some of the others I've been to.  Not quite as packed and a little bit neater (but not by much).  

That said, it's the same old Wal Mart experience that people complain about.  Crowded aisles, an interesting clientele, confusing signage and generally unpleasant staff.  

This particular trip was to have a duplicate house key made.  The only reason this store earned a second star was that the associate working the automotive department broke from the traditional Wal Mart employee model and was very friendly and helpful.  She got everything taken care of quickly and courteously.  Thank you!

"Thanks for steering me in the right direction, my friends. I'm staying down the street from Delachaise and just had the steak frites based on a few good reviews. I was not disappointed!

Someone said it reminds them of a NYC type of bar. I agree. In fact I'd say this place is very similar to d.b.a. in the East Village...but with New Orleans style, I can only guess (I've been here 3 hours). 

- 6 well chosen taps (Spaten, Schneider Weisse, Flying Dog...) - I opted for local and had the NOLA Hopitoulas. 
- Lots of bottles.
- Excellent menus for aged Scotch (Macallen, Lagavulin...), Irish Whiskey, Bourbon, and Gin (Hendricks, Plymouth, Old Raj...). 
- New punk and alternative (The Killers, Radiohead...) played relatively low, but it was dinner time. 
- Steak frites were great - relatively thin steak, but juicy and cooked to order. Frites are fried in duck fat cut with oil. They were crispy and had a rich oil flavor.

"I absolutely LOVE pizza - it's my favorite food. I'm from New York, so my standards are high. I've been looking for good pizza on the Main Line ever since moving here 20 years ago, and I finally found it. 

Felicia's rates in my 'top 5' pizza places. Johns on Bleeker Street in New York is tops, followed closely by Marra's in South Philadelphia. Felicia's is right behind those two. It's REAL pizza, with stringly, genuine mozarella cheese, chunks of real tomato in the sauce, the crust is crispy on the bottom but still chewey. The balance of cheese vs. sauce is just right. The mushrooms are fresh, not canned, and the pieces of roasted pepper are big. If the crust had just a touch more salt, and if there were a few more pieces of roasted pepper, it would be an absolutely top contender, but that doesn't take away from it being the very best in the suburbs. Overall, it's an excellent pizza, by far the best on the Main Line, right up there with the best you'll find in South Philly - it's absolutely delicious, very satisfying in every way. 

As others have said, the place is very unpretentious. There are a couple of tables inside that perhaps 4 people could fit at, but the most fun is on the roof - literally. The view is only of Ardmore rooftops, but it's fun, and different from most other places. Tony is very friendly, as was the girl working as cashier/helper.

"Here a hair, there a hair, everywhere...you get the idea. Let me start off by saying that my family has patronized this restaurant since it opened several years ago. We have watched it transform from an above average buffet, crowded for lunch and dinner, to a place where we simply cannot even eat at any longer. On most days it's a ghost town inside, a sprinkling of people here and there. The food used to be pretty good, not anymore. The items on the buffet are tasteless, lukewarm and very rarely restocked. The sushi tastes as though it has been refrigerated / frozen and then put out. I'm not writing this review out of any manner of malice, we loved this place and are probably in a minority as to being customers that have stayed here since it opened. Recently my wife and I stopped there for lunch. There was about 10 people in the entire restaurant, and this was in the middle of lunchtime. After having a cup of what was supposedly Hot & Sour soup, which neither looked like or tasted like HS soup, I went to get a piece of Salmon. Upon returning to my seat and starting to eat, I suddenly noticed a very straight black hair in the piece of flounder. It was on the underside of the flounder, so I'm certain it was there from when it was brought out from the kitchen. DISGUSTING!!. Shortly after this my wife brought back a plate of crab bake, and what was in it, another hair, identical to the one on my plate. At this point we were nearly nauseous. I suggested to my wife that she get her dessert and we would go, which she did. Upon returning to the table I couldn't believe what I saw as she sat down, ANOTHER HAIR ON HER PLATE OF PUDDING AND WATERMELON!
I can tolerate a lot of things, but hair in my food isn't one of them. 
I brought this to the attention of the owners, who simply shrugged it off. I very politely asked for some manner of refund or credit, being that we literally didn't eat after seeing all the hair and he shrugged his shoulders and said no. Now we have dumped a lot of money into this place over the past couple of years, for lunch and dinner. We took our children there, along with their families and friends, and I couldn't believe they wouldn't offer us at least a partial credit for a spoiled lunch. I looked the owner in the eyes, and asked him, ""is the $15 more important to you then our continued patronage?"". Again, he shrugged it off, only this time with a smirk. 

Believe me when I tell you, AVOID THIS PLACE. The food is horrible, there is next to nothing on the hibachi grill and on many occasions there isn't even anyone there to cook it. It isn't unusual to see the owner come running over to the grill himself when people have been standing there for an extended time holding their plate. 
The bathroom doors are kept open, and the bathrooms absolutely reek!, the floors are slimy, and there is no AC in the rest rooms. 
The cleanliness is way below acceptable. The carpets are filthy and stained, the tables less than clean, and apparently they never replace burnt out light bulbs.
PLEASE REALIZE, WE USED TO LIKE THIS PLACE, BUT IT ISN'T ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT IT USED TO BE. WE WERE HOPING THAT THEY WOULD TURN THINGS AROUND BUT INSTEAD IT'S SLIDING DOWNHILL RAPIDLY. MY GUESS IS THAT THEY ARE IN SERIOUS FINANCIAL STRAITS. HOPEFULLY IT WILL CLOSE DOWN SOON AND / OR REOPEN WITH CARING OWNERS WHO SERVE FOOD SANS HAIR!!
We pass three other buffets to get to this one. We had gotten to know the owners on a first name basis, and at one time looked forward to going there. We kept hoping that it would improve but it hasn't. If you are in the mood for a Chinese buffet, go to the one next to Wal-Mart, or one of the other Supreme buffets. There is one on Cottman Avenue and one on Grant ave. We have been to the one on Cottman, they offer much more on the buffet and the food is hot and well stocked. Guess where we are going from now on. 
It's a shame, this place appears to be going under, and it is bordering on disgusting at this point. SO UNLESS YOU LIKE SOME ROUGHAGE IN THE FORM OF HUMAN (HOPEFULLY) HAIR IN YOUR GENERAL TSO'S STAY CLEAR OF THIS PLACE. 
I have no problem whatsoever putting my contact info on this review. Unlike a lot of the reviews you see for this place that suddenly sing its praises, mine is genuine.",0,0.82421875,2.9375,0.8125,2.90625,0.03149414,2.953125,0.7109375,2.9375,0.81640625,2.890625,0.79296875,2.9375,0.7578125,2.921875

"This is a large open air restaurant in John's Pass that is (as the name implies) shaped like a large straw hut. The location and decor are okay. They even have some outdoor seating to get views of the water. However, the food was unfortunately below average. Though the prices are not bad, you can tell that their food is not fresh and mostly frozen stuff.

Their entrees come with these fried potato chips that appear to be made in bulk by the staff. They were all hard, stale and half of them were cold so I assume on the following days they reuse what is not sold. The tacos they served were also bland and flavorless.

"Visiting from out of town and wanted to try a Mexican restaurant. Let me start off by saying this is nothing more an overpriced Taco Bell. The service is slow, the food prep is extremely slow.  They offer your first chips and salsa for free and anything after that is a charge. Ok sure, you don't want customers to fill up on chips and salsa.  Guacamole is $12 and has no taste. Store bought guac is much better. Was missing the garlic or salt taste you normally get with guacamole. 

The menu is very limited and extremely non-descriptive. Lastly, does not have traditional Mexican entrees to choose from. No tacos, no fajitas, no burritos, you can order a quesadilla as an appetizer but it's over 20 bucks. 

I had a hard time finding an entree and almost decided to not get anything. The waitress didn't grasp the idea that I was looking for traditional Mexican food.  I finally was able to figure out an entree which again took over 45 minutes to arrive and managers were noncommittal that the food prep took a long time. I observed other tables were getting upset and one table of six or more left. My entree was only 6 shrimp smothered in cheese.  Ridiculous! After I complained the waitress said she could bring me rice and beans but for an up charge! I said never mind take the plate back. Her manager came over and said no worries we won't do a $6 up charge for beans and rice on top of a $28 entree charge for Six shrimp smothered in melted cheese. 

Dessert has two choices. Churros for $10 or Ice Cream for $12 and they put caramel on top. Two choices for dessert is a disgrace and shouts out terrible menu skills. 

The atmosphere and restaurant interior decoration is nice built what appears to be an old warehouse and they left the industrial look which gives it a nice look.

The cheese on the enchiladas was not even fully melted, and it was apparent that they were frozen because the entire plate had water on it which had soaked into the tostada shell.

"With pretty good reviews on yelp, we decided to stop in on our last night in town for dinner. We enjoyed sitting outside and the place was packed so our hopes were high! Unfortunately by the end of the meal they fell pretty far. We started out with two drinks-a rum runner and a mango delight. It took a while for our server to get our drinks which is fine, but he came back to ask us for us drink order twice after we already put it in. The rum runner was ok, while the mango delight(I think this is their signature drink) tasted strong and cheap-not in a good way. It was not very good and if we for some reason go back I wouldn't be getting drinks again. After we ordered our food our server came back 10 minutes later and asked us to repeat our order, so at that point we were a little frustrated... it was also happening to the two tables beside us that he was covering as well. 

We got crab fries to share which were the best part of the meal! I had the Buffalo grouper sandwich which was ok but small and dry/lacking sauce. I was supposed to have slaw as my side, not fries which I ended up getting, so the way the service was going I just ate them. My boyfriend got fried shrimp which was good.

When we got the bill, we were still finishing up. The server came back a few minutes later and literally stood over us until we dug out our cash... it was clear we weren't ready yet and he should've come back in a few minutes... but continued to stand over us with his hand out.

"Perdigon el Sabor is my first experience with Venezulan cuisine. 

First there are a few points of interest:

First of all, it is VERY easy to miss as it is wedged between Hank's catfish BBQ and a KFC. Honestly, the haristyling place draws your eye before you see Perdigon in the corner,trying to hide.

Second, the parking lot is miniscule. One of the few advantages Tampa has over places like Chicago should be ample parking for even the dinkiest of business. I came in around 2 pm, and by the grace of God I was able to park. Note: Dont try any Fast and Furious style antics in here

The restaurant is nicely decorated, modern yet classy. However it seems to suffer from Chicago popular restaurant syndrome- extremely tiny yet popular with patrons. 

I ordered a lulu drink, 1 cachapa, and an Arepa el sabor.
The server was nice and spoke mostly Spanish to me(maybe she thought Brown guy =Hispanic?)
The lulu , a freshly made drink made of a citrus (naranjilla?) was refreshing.

However, from the time I ordered 2:05 pm, I waited and waited. Despite the assurance from the server,

 I waited 46 minutes for my cachapa and arepa. 

The cachapa with guyanes cheese was nice. It is a corn based pancake with a nice melted cheese. It has sweet and savoury elements. I would consider it a breakfast or lunch item IMO.

The arepa was very good, It is a corn based sandwich esque item with chunks of chorizo, chicken, and avocado with the aforementioned cheese.
The chicken was grilled and juicy as was the chorizo. 

One  thing I give them major props for is the avocado. In most restaurants in the US, avocado is usually upcharged to any item and when it comes out, it is usually some processed shlock or stale. Thankfully, the avocado slices were tasty and fresh. Yay for aguacate!

FYI the prices on the website are outdated.
 The arepa el sabor is $7.00 The cachapas with guyanese is $6.75

Honestly the arepa was pretty big, so you may not even need anything else for lunch.

Despite the great food which is 4/5 IMO, the extreme wait time is unacceptable. 
I went on a weekday afternoon;I'm glad I didnt try and come on the weekend lol.
I didnt order a lot of items or anything out of the ordinary and I was by myself.

I would come if you have no time restrictions and on a weekday. 
Im a quick eater and it took me 1 hour 15 min just to get in an out.

Good food, but all these factors make it an occasional jaunt IMO",1,0.90234375,2.65625,0.97265625,2.734375,0.359375,3.109375,0.953125,2.609375,0.9296875,2.84375,0.91015625,2.65625,0.9375,2.765625

"4.5 stars

Went with my sister, bro-in-law and hubby for our annual thanksgiving grown-up evening out.  

We got the tasting menu which meant we got to try everything on the menu for $50/person.  It's a small plates place a little far off the beaten path in south philly although we got a parking spot easily.  Menu's written on the blackboard,each dish as three important ingredients.  Surprisingly, most dishes were vegetable based so for all the food we ate it felt relatively healthy.  

The only dish my sis and I didn't like was the mackerel because we don't like fishy fish, but our top picks were the tempura battered leeks, the veal topped gnocchi, the turkey ragu pasta, the Brussels and the beets.

The service was great and the BYOB means you can drink a much better wine or two for much less.

The only major downside was how noisy the place was--some noise abatement would help those of us whose hearing's beginning to go.  Desserts were fine, not super-amazing.

Overall a really nice place with creative dishes. Highly recommend!",2,1.0,5.0,0.921875,3.578125,0.53125,3.953125,1.0,5.0,0.8984375,5.0,0.99609375,5.0,1.44355e-07,3.125

"Stopped in for lunch and at first the waitress seemed very accommodating.
My friend's lunch was good - tuna sandwich and she was satisfied with the soup as well.
My experience was not so great - I ordered crepes with fruit and when I received them it felt as if the crepe was a piece of cardboard.  No delicious crepe as I anticipated and very difficult to eat.  This was covered in whipped cream which was a bit too much.  When I mentioned that the meal was not good the waitress immediately started to interrogate me and commented that others love this dish.  I am a fairly good cook and good crepes done properly are whipped and taste good.  This was like eating a piece of cardboard.  Then the waitress told me I should put syrup on it - would not have made a difference.
I generously paid the bill and added a tip but will not be going back.
Felt intimidated and insulted and where I was looking for a nice lunch, was sorely disappointed.
To top it off, the crepe was cold and I was very unhappy with the food and the attitude of the waitress.",0,1.0,2.0,1.9717561e-13,4.5,0.033935547,1.546875,1.0,1.6640625,1.882654e-10,3.671875,0.78125,2.109375,7.1525574e-07,2.640625

"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. This service was one of the worst I've ever received in Edmonton. The waiter, short haired woman (hopefully management will address this seeing the review). One of our friends wasn't feeling well and wasn't going to order. She told my friend she couldn't sit here since they didn't order, even though the rest of us were ordering. On top of that, we had waited 20 minutes before someone even came to say hi to us. She ordered us to leave if our friend wouldn't order anything, forcing money out of our pockets. She gave us extremely horrible attitude and being a long term returning customer I am no longer bringing anyone back here. This unprofessional behaviour has ought to stop, she claimed the place to be a restaurant and not somewhere to enjoy, even though again the rest of us were ordering food.

"This is my first time at the Golden Bowl, as I move along my quest to try all the Chinese restaurants in the Brandon / Valrico area.  Rating a restaurant with such a large menu is difficult, if you are alone and only ordering 3 items, as you are not trying enough items to have a statistically significant sample.  The moral is to consider this a review of the items I ordered, not all of their offerings.
 
On entering the restaurant it is evident that this is primarily a take out and delivery establishment.  There were two booths and two tables.  I stepped up to the counter and ordered Mongolian Beef, Hot and Sour Soup, and a Shrimp Roll, and then sat at a table.  Within a few minutes one of the cooks brought me the Hot and Sour soup in a Styrofoam bowl.  No napkins and no spoon, I had to get up and retrieve a small plastic soup spoon and several bar sized napkins.  My first impression of the Hot and Sour soup was that it was very hot in temperature, but not spicy, devoid of any meat, and otherwise lacking flavor.  I set the soup aside to let it cool while I focused on the other items.  Jumping ahead to when I came back to the soup, some of my initial impressions proved false.  Scooping up from the bottom of the bowl, there were some pieces of meat.  Some of the items from the bottom of the bowl also had some red pepper flakes, so if I got a spoonful of these it was definitely spicy.  Not as bad as my original impression, but not an item I would recommend.
 
A few minutes after received my soup, one of the cooks brought over my Mongolian Beef and Shrimp roll.  Although I had indicated I would be eating in (which they obviously knew since the soup was brought in an open container), the Mongolian Beef was served up in a closed Styrofoam container with the shrimp roll in a bag on top of the Mongolian Beef container.  I neglected to mention earlier that I ordered the Mongolian Beef off of the lunch menu (which is available until 3:30 PM) so it included fried rice and a drink.  The portion of Mongolian Beef and fried rice was very generous.  At this point I need to take the blame for not looking at the menu better.  I tasted the Mongolian Beef and found it to be rather bland while I was expecting a spicy dish.  I quickly checked the takeout menu and saw that the Mongolian Beef was not marked with a red pepper symbol, so in essence I got what I ordered.  Even taking that into account I found both the main dish and the fried rice to be rather flavorless.  Maybe this establishment has some dishes they excel at, and I just ordered the wrong things.  Otherwise my overall rating would have been lower.  Perhaps when I have completed my survey of all the Chinese restaurants in the area I will return, and try some of the other items on the menu.  
 
I did take a number of pictures, and I would encourage you to look at them all, as they may have an impact on your impression of the restaurant.",0,0.14257812,2.671875,0.087890625,2.78125,0.83984375,2.734375,0.10595703,2.703125,0.15625,2.640625,0.140625,2.671875,0.10107422,2.734375

In my honest opinion this place wasn't that good. The selection of foods for the hot pot wasn't that large and the seafood such as crabs were charged by pound.

"Yay to Spanish food in the new market! Lima Fusion is tucked away in a corner of the market and easy to miss, despite having one of the more robust menus in comparison to the other market vendors. They pretty much give you a solid glimpse of latin cuisine from ceviche, empanadas, tostones and roasted chicken! It is amazing how much they can whip up in that tiny space.

We tried two different plates. The one was the Yellow Chicken and rice, which honestly was a miss for me. It was not very seasoned and just didn't really give you anything to rave about, so if you are more into lightly seasoned food, this is for you. The plate that really took it home for me was the chicken with tostones! This was flavorful, delicious, huge and well priced! My sister and I shared this plate and we both ate and felt full after. It also was probably because we each got an empanada before eating this!

"Norton's Pastrami and Deli is located in downtown Santa Barbara on Figueroa Street between State and Chapala Street. There is metered street parking and paid lots close by.

Norton's is small with bar seating and tables available inside. This shop was also featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Norton's is known for their Pastrami Sandwiches but also offer Hot Dogs, Corned Beef, Grilled Chicken, Philly Steaks, and Melts. 

I tried Mom's BLT with Onion Rings. Mom's BLT was served with Crispy Pastrami, Chipotle Mayo, Lettuce and Tomato on Sour Dough Bread. I ordered the Whole Size which was $10.89
The size of Mom's BLT was the size of regular squared shaped sandwich bread. The Pastrami was average but not dripping with grease with toasted bread. The Onion Rings were nicely deep fried. Had a nice consistency with the batter used because it was not too thick and was crispy. 

Overall, the price is a little steep for the portion served. I would come back and try other sandwiches here.",1,1.0,3.28125,0.640625,4.9375,3.33786e-05,2.5,1.2903456e-11,3.046875,1.0,2.640625,0.90625,4.15625,2.9649527e-10,2.109375

"Three of us ate there Sunday March 12th.  My uncle had never been there before but did notice they had good crowds.  He asked what was the dish that was the most popular.  He was told the Southern Fried Chicken was the best.  We ordered 2 Chicken dinners and 1 Southern Chicken Hash.  My wife had the hash.  She could not eat it.  It was to have a sherry wine cream sauce,  It was nothing but hot.  I had the fried chicken so I traded with her.  It tasted like hot sauce with peppers.  I think they added creole sauce instead of sherry sauce.  The cream sauce was watery.  Both the wife and uncle said the chicken was very bland, had no taste.  It looked like a big chicken nugget.  General Lee would spin in his grave at the thought of this being called ""Southern Fried Chicken"".  The coleslaw had no flavor. It looked great but had no flavor.  The sauce tasted like it consisted of skim milk.   Salt and pepper added the only flavor....the salt shaker was at an outdoor table and the top was rusty. The Coke was flat.

"We stopped in to try this place because a good number of the reviews are favorable. Sadly, we were led astray by the Yelpers of Wiregrass. 

We ordered a NY style pizza and some wood fired buffalo wings. The wings were relatively tasty and super hot but there was a turn for the worst when the pizza arrived. As Gordon Ramsay would bloodcurdlingly bellow, it was RAW. Raw dough all throughout the pizza. The outside edges were the only parts that were not raw. In addition, the pizza was sopping wet and soggy, with the toppings glooping off into piles of sadness if you tried to take a bite or move a slice. 

This depressed me. When we informed our server of this distress, he was defensive and made an excuse for the pizza, saying it was just how they do it and it was ""Italian style"". Yes, their raw New York style pizza is apparently ""Italian"". 

The next part was our mistake. We spoke to our server about what to do about the pizza mishap and agreed to have the same pizza again, only for it to be ""well done"". After this decision, I perused the other Yelp reviews and found some that resembled what we were experiencing, including one that contained a story of being yelled at by the manager because they were not happy with their pizza. 

The replacement pizza that arrived at our table was mostly cooked and edible. The toppings still sloughed off when you tried to eat it, and it was still sloppy and wet but we ate it because we don't like to waste food and our previous pizza had just gone into the garbage. I also didn't want to be yelled at.

They are also creative with their other sandwiches. ""The Raven"" was very tasty on some excellent bread. Skip the pretzel appetizer, terrible.

"Went here on fourth of July before the fireworks with over an hour and a half to spare. Specifically asked if we would have enough time and was reassured that it would be no issue since the display was to be delayed slightly due to rain anyways. After an hour and a half still with no food, we asked for it to be packaged to go. Waitress was rude and said that she warned us about the delays, which she did to a limited degree, but not to the full extent. Ended up eating out of a Styrofoam container in a parking lot while watching the last half of the fireworks that we didn't miss while waiting. 

As for the food, I had the combo with brisket and chicken. The brisket was great but the chicken was too dry. For sides, I had the collard greens and baked beans, both were alright but nothing special in my opinion. 

If you have hours to waste waiting and don't mind poor service then this place might be for you but otherwise I would recommend taking your craving for bbq elsewhere.

The salmon was cooked perfectly. When I took the lid off the bowl- the way the aroma assaulted my nose in a good way... it should be illegal! The charred peppers and onions were a perfect touch. The Aloo Gobi was good but not enough veggies for me. The star of the show was the chili chicken. Sweet and spicy, grilled and tender, this app is a must have.

"Well, where to start!  If I could give it a zero I would, this place sucks.  The first impression I got was about 15 feet from the front door, where the smell of grease and oil are radiating out the building, which you can imagine what your clothes/self, smells like upon leaving.  We had a party here on 12/1/12 with 22 people.  When we arrived there might have been 2 tables in the downstairs dining area, then our large group, which was seated in the upstairs, in something that resembled a dirty diner, located in a basement.  Very dirty.  Now to my favorite part, the menu!  There has to be close to 300 items on the menu!  For example there were about 40 appetizers.  Upon trying to decipher the Britannica of menus, it occurred to me that nothing on this menu could possibly be fresh, which I was correct.  Everything that our party got was frozen/freezer burnt garbage.  Some people enjoyed their meals because of the price, which most everything on the menu is under $10 and in my opinion not worth that, I have had better food in a gas station.  We were told by our (1) server for a group of 22, that they closed the rest of the restaurant to take care of our party!  JOKES!

The only appetizer that we got took over an hour, which was a bucket of melted cellophane cheese, they called queso!  Now to dinner.  It came out 3 plates at a time, by the (1) server; my plate came out on the last run, most everyone in the group had finished.  It was a half hour from start to finish from the first plates to mine.     

Conclusion, we were there for about 3 hours, not because we wanted to hang out after the meal, but because the process took that long.  I couldn't imagine if the restaurant would have been full!  Everything was frozen, fried, heated up crap.  My clothes smelled worse than they did when I worked in a restaurant!  2 people in our group got sick because of their meal; I took 2 bites of my gyro sandwich before I had the bus boy take it away, which he was already doing when my food came out.

This spot used to me a mugshots. It was dark with POOR ventilation - you'd get a coffee and smell like bacon when you left, free of charge. The staff were confused and absentminded. The set up for order and pick up was a bumblemuck.

OCF does it right. Bright open light, excellent ventilation. Plenty of chairs and tables with access to wifi and outlets. The space is large enough that families with kids don't disrupt the folks who come to study or meet for business.

The staff is always friendly and helpful and they have GLUTEN FREE options! Of course lactose free as well. THANK GOD!

"Yes, we read all the negative reviews of this place, but decided to go there while spending the night at the Philadelphia airport due to a very early morning flight. To be fair, we had gone to this place one other time without seeing any reviews and we pretty much agreed with most of the two star reviews, but we wanted a local real food restaurant, so went again. 
Starting with the low point of the experience, the gin and tonic was pitiful. It was served in a small glass filled mostly with ice. Tasted very watered down. On the other hand my glass of house Pinot Grigio was very adequate. Beer would have been the safe bet.
Now, moving on to the pleasant parts: the waitress was very nice, but very busy with a party in the next room, so we waited a while for service. The tablecloths were bright and clean and refined looking. The decor is what it is: old.
So far, only two stars, THEN we got our food. We had calves liver with gravy and onions and a crab cake (not on the menu.) Both dishes were outstanding! The calves liver was cooked perfectly to medium rare and was delicious. The crabcake was fantastic! Our waitress warned that it would be baked. It turned out to have been baked in a cup shape, so that only the bottom was golden. The rest was pure jumbo lump crab meat, served with a fantastic mayo-chipolte sauce. Only the weight of the crabmeat held it together. Absolutely wonderful. One was more than enough when adding the pretty ordinary, but acceptable sides. Noteworthy were the beets which had a touch of cinnamon--delicious. (And I don't like beets.) 
We will definitely go back for that menu alone if circumstances allow.",1,0.0859375,3.21875,0.084472656,3.203125,0.007019043,3.265625,0.09423828,3.171875,0.09277344,3.15625,0.07861328,3.21875,0.084472656,3.1875

"I was seriously hesitant getting tamales in the midwest because the style varies from restaurant to restaurant, most of which basically suck!  These tamales are no joke! Truly *authentic*. I ordered a black bean taco and a veggie tamale, while my husband opted for the veggie nachos loaded. The tamale was huge and had the perfect ratio of stuffing to masa. The masa moisture was spot on and had excellent flavor! The staff also gifted me with a baby size sweet tamale that hit the spot as a dessert option. As for the nachos, I was more than pleasantly surprised! They had a huge amount of toppings and the cheese sauce they pour over the top doesn't taste like the shitty processed cheese sauce that every Mexican restaurant in the midwest serves. The highlight, however, were the tortilla chips that were freshly fried and thick af! Even toward the end, they stayed crispy and firm enough to load up!

The first time I had come here was really quite a disaster - a mess of dissatisfied costumers bringing back the wrong drinks, people bring served quickly and others forgotten about .. not to mention the line out the door probably due to the young new staff trying to work the iPad for orfers. It was horribly disorganized and I probably would have given 3 stars based off of that. 
However I came back yesterday to give it another shot and my experience this time was really nice. It was late in the evening and there wasn't many people there. I got their coffee plum crumble and a chai latte, the boyfriend got their tiramisu and a latte. The chai was good! The only odd part were the bits at the bottom of the cup that j found a little displeasing - but still good regardless. 
I really enjoyed the crumble it is something I'd certainly come back for. Not too sweet, great combination of flavors - yum!!

"I've eaten here a few times on my way through town. I'm usually in Reno for quick business meeting or stopping off for a quick bite before heading to Boise or the Bay Area. We stop at the Nugget primarily because it's right off I-80, easy off, easy on. If I'm hungry and feeling like American food, I'll head to the Rotisserie Buffet but if I'm looking for something different and tasty I go here. I've found the food to be tasty, inexpensive and quick. I especially enjoy the duck and rice. The duck is moist and tasty and the rice is sticky, the way I like it.

"I was surprised to see how desolate this place was when we arrived on a Wednesday evening but, it was a pleasant surprise since I wanted quick food and drinks.

Burger with Baked Potato:  The burger was cooked to the medium temperature that I ordered and it was juicy with plenty of toppings.  The baked potato had bacon bits on it and I mean bacon bits from a container (fake bacon bits) and honestly I didn't even know they sold these anymore.  I am surprised that a restaurant can't just make their own but, I think it probably adds to the charm of this place.  It was good but, was it worth the price?  The answer is probably not.  So what do you come here for?  The huge ass potent drinks that's what.

Neptune's Monsoon:  Sweet baby Jesus is there a warning label on this drink?  No!  Should there be?  Yes!  I had one in the restaurant and one to go.  Do I remember most of the night?  No!  Was it worth it?  Um YES!!!!  The best thing about a well-made cocktail that is too strong for consumption is when you can't taste the booze.  Beware this leads to nasty sugar withdrawal hang overs!  Would I do it again?  Yes I will next time I am in NOLA.  Why?  Because sometimes you just need a strong drink and a case of the drunks that doesn't cost you a $60.00 bar tab.

Mushrooms:  We ordered the side order of mushrooms that were supposed to be in a burgundy wine sauce but, I would pass on them since the flavor isn't cooked into the mushrooms and just in the broth.

Is this place a tourist trap type place spotted with locals warming bar stools sometimes?  Yes but, you have to do it once just for the drinks at least!  You may not remember the night but, you have a to go souvenir cup that will remind you that you drank here!

We asked for refills after having to flag down the only waitress for the entire restaurant and we again kept waiting and waiting. By the time we finished our food we still did not have a refill and decided to just grab our check. Once again we had to flag down the waitress because she never once asked how the food tasted, if everything turned out like ordered or brought us the refills we asked for.

"Haven't been to this location in a while, so friends and I went for lunch.  They weren't busy at all so we were seated without a wait. Unfortunately, service was incredibly slow and sub par.

The bread basket was cold and doughy. (What happened to the deliciously crisp bread?)

Sat around for ten minutes before we could even place our drink orders, and then another ten or so until our waitress bothered to return for the rest of our orders.

Got the zucchini fritte appetizer. While it was delicious, crispy and super hot when it got to our table, it took way too long to get to us. 

The rest of our meals were simply so-so.  

Friends' fettuccine alfredos were just okay. Other friend's eggplant parm was drowned in sauce. My Maggiano's side salad was the biggest disappointment - there was no discernible dressing on it at all, yet the lettuce was all soggy.  The supposed ""crispy prosciutto"" on top wasn't crispy and tasted more like bacon bits.

Our waitress was less than helpful and only came by once to check on us. She'd ask if we wanted refills, then take ten minutes before returning with them.

All in all, a mediocre experience. Probably won't go back.",0,1.0,2.015625,5.2386895e-09,2.890625,0.00027275085,1.8046875,1.0,1.015625,1.946887e-12,4.0625,0.8984375,2.40625,1.0,1.296875

"I don't mean to be a hater, but honestly after finally eating at Sabrina's for brunch this weekend, the only explanation I can come up with as to Sabrina's insane wait and their 4 star rating must be that there must not be much brunch spots in the Philly area or people don't know good brunch if it smacked them in the face. 

I've been hearing my Philly friends rave about Sabrina's for years and I'd put it at the top of my ""must try"" places for a long time, especially since I'm a fan of brunch. My weekend trip to Philly finally fated me with Sabrina's.

We pulled up and the massive crowd outside was a bit intimidating. It reminded me of Clinton Street Baking in NYC and automatically I was hoping that I wouldn't be let down here as I have been at Clinton St. 

We get seated after a year later and proceeded to put in our drink orders. They've got some decent coffee which they are very quick to refill. I ordered the carmelized French toast, as I was advised that it was the ""must order"" item. My sister got the bubbles pancake which was a special made with buttermilk pancakes topped with ricotta orange pound cake crumbles,roasted almonds, dried apricots, and peach Vanilla syrup, and Orange Apricot butter. I was disappointed in my Challah French toast, nothing special at all and it was not hot enough seems like it's been sitting in the kitchen for a few minutes longer than it needed to be. But the Bubbles pancake was pretty fantastic.

"I'm revising this to 5 stars because I finally went back last week to eat after having drank there a couple times.  Had a shrimp bowl.  Fresh crispy flavor and colossal shrimp.

OLD REVIEW:
I went a couple times this summer and the first thing I noticed when I walked in as I do when I walk in any place for the first time was the attention of the servers.  As soon as I walk in, I was greeted with a smile and the bartender told me she would be ""right with you"" as she finished up with another customer.

How simple?  How novel a concept, to notion with a friendly ""I'll be right with you""?!!!

You know how many places and servers don't do that and just allow you to sit while they ignore you UNTIL they get done doing what they're doing. 

Engine Rose has that part down after two visits just for beer.  Atmosphere and decor are very stylish, modern and St. Pete/Florida as well.  Very breezy too!  Even in summer.  Beer prices were solid (about $5 per for what I was drinking-pale ales) and I can't wait to get into the burgers and apps.  Rating may go up after I eat there. 

Great job at doing something simple where others often fail.  Great attention to service and detail, simple and comfortable menu at a good price.

It's only not depressing if it's the only store in town and then it's a whole mother level of depressing. 

This is probably the best review ever.   Danny you get an F.  One star. Clueless service, long wait time, and unscrupulous business practices. I'm sure your girl likes you calling me.

"I wasn't very impressed with this brewery. The service was not good at all, I saw more standing around talking then actually serving and checking on customers.

"National Mechanics is the kind of place that draws a certain crowd: friendly, fun, you know the type, where conversation with strangers are a breeze and the atmosphere is energetic.

Alcohol is alcohol as far as I'm concerned, so I go (and return to) places for more than merely what they pour. That being said, I found that they made decent standard mixed drinks  --- and yes, a bar can easily mess up the simplest. My wife insists that last night's was the best made Cosmo around (actually, she said it was the best ever but that may have been the alcohol talking, no pun intended).

A standout for me was the bar food. Particularly the wings: Hands down the best wings I've tasted in all of Philly. Crispy and meaty, with outstanding honey BBQ sauce.

"AYCE Sushi?!?! I'm IN! They have an AYCE dinner and AYCE lunch... lunch is just slightly different in that some rolls aren't on that menu... but technically you could do the dinner menu during lunch, up to you!

I don't really remember what rolls I ordered, some were memorable, some... not so much. There was one with scallops that I didn't care too much for... it was kind of bland so I just felt like I was eating cold mush. I also don't remember what rolls I had since the waitress just plopped the rolls on the table without telling us what we were eating. So I basically ate everything blindly and had to assume what I got.  So... some rolls were good.. some were... not? 

I got the house salad since I was desperate for some kind of vegetables after eating buffets day in and day out. I felt like I owed my body THAT MUCH. Well, when it came... it was basically soaking in the dressing. It would have been good if they didn't pour so much dressing. The cut up strawberries was a nice touch with the salad. I would probably skip the miso soup. It seemed very thick and powdery... they needed some more water to dilute the soup or something. The moondog appetizers were really good, nice and crunchy with the filling inside being tasty too. The poppers were good too, I don't remember much about it... just that I liked it! The mussels were really good too. I usually hate mussels, but the mussels (off the appetizers) were amazing, with the cheese on top and everything. The quail egg shooter is pretty good too.. although I'm not sure if you're supposed to chew on it or just swallow the whole thing. I swallowed it since I couldn't bare chewing on it... but it was good and had a nice spice that followed it. If you can look pass a raw egg... then go for it!

Overall the food was good, I can't really complain. Some needed work, but maybe it's just my personal preference... it could be delicious to you! Would definitely recommend this place, cheap, affordable, good quality, and I didn't have the runs after eating here... so that's always a plus! The only thing I would ding them on is the service, they seem all over the place. I think it would be better if they had one waiter to one section, instead of 3 different waiters waiting on the same table... just for the sake of consistency! We ended up waiting for several of our orders several times... watched it go to other tables because they weren't communicating with each other... they made it up by hooking us up with desserts though (which was really good... don't remember what it was called but it had ice cream and tempura fried bananas). So if you're tired of eating at the mediocre buffets in the Casino's and want something different... then head on over here!",2,0.022827148,2.875,0.01977539,2.859375,0.0005683899,3.25,0.019165039,2.875,0.017333984,2.921875,0.021850586,2.875,0.017700195,2.890625
"It all started with a beef patty in Jamaica. We visited Jamaica last summer and tried an amazing beef patty at a sidewalk vendor. It was kind of like an empanada, but bigger and with a lighter pastry crust. It was a melt in your mouth delicious blend of mildly spicy ground beef and cheese. So, when I discovered this restaurant I was excited to try the beef patty and hoped the delicious island treat would be available close to home. Well, it was pretty good; but not as good as Jamaica. It wasn't overflowing with filling and it was served luke warm, not hot enough. If the filling had been doubled, and I could make it hotter, it would have been perfect. So, the flavors were good.
The soup of the day Friday was ""Goat Head"" Soup aka ""Mannish Water"". I saw that on the menu and ordered it just to be adventurous. I am proud to be able to say I have tried goat head soup; but I wouldn't order it again. The meat was very tender; but the fattier parts of meat and bone in the soup were not appealing. The broth had good stew flavor with dense dumplings and carrot slices.
The best thing I ate here was the jerk chicken. I will definitely return to get the jerk chicken again. It was perfectly smoked and had a delicious sauce on the side that really enhanced the flavor. They offer catering and I think this jerk chicken would be a great item to cater for my next office luncheon.
There were some really great looking plates around us at other tables that made me want to return and try more items here. I'd recommend this restaurant for unique and delicious Jamaican options for lunch or dinner.
The atmosphere is casual. The staff is friendly. Service was very good. 
Tip: Be sure to try the Jamaican juices they offer, with whatever you eat.",2,0.00018787384,4.25,0.0005607605,4.03125,0.50390625,3.15625,0.001411438,3.859375,0.0005607605,4.15625,0.00025177002,4.25,0.00016498566,4.0625

Beside that, they put out some good coupons sometimes.  The Chicken Fettucine Carbonara is normally about $11.39, and the coupon made it only $7.99.  Beware though!  This entree, which was a normal-size portion, was 1100-1400 calories, depending on whether you ate the bread stick that came with it.  Oops!  I will say, however, that this pasta entree was pretty darn tasty though.",1,1.0,4.28125,9.8587805e-14,4.3125,2.4563633e-08,1.9921875,0.19921875,2.78125,1.0,5.0,0.9375,4.15625,0.18164062,3.28125
"I've been here three times already and I have no intention of slowing that frequency down!  I think this place has a lot of potential.  I really hope that people catch on to it and help to make it successful.
From the outside, you're not sure what to expect.  It was once a Shoney's so it's hard to imagine it as fine dining spot.  However, when you walk in...you can sense the attention to detail in decor.  It's a wide open space so not very intimate but a generally pleasing space.  
Now to the food...The blue cheese chips - OMG delicious!  The salmon dip - YUM!
I had the ribs on my first trip and was very pleased with them.  Second time around, I had the chicken and waffle.  I've been to Roscoe's in LA (more than one location)Gladys Knight's in Atlanta and Sylvia's in NYC and I must say, Legacy's version of chicken and waffles is outstanding!!  It was my pleasure to devour this meal.  It is extremely filling though so be prepared to feel like a porker when you're done.  I actually saved some for dinner and was equally happy eating it the second time.
I had the Legacy Burger as Mmy entree on my third visit was not impressed, unfortunately.  I found the burger to be overcooked and the fries not very tasty.  In spite of this last experience, I still recommend this spot.  They offer a nice change from some of the other chains out in Metairie and truly serve delicious meals.

"I often stop at this Panera bread on my way home from work.  It is in a convenient little shopping center right off of Route 3 in West Chester.

I don't only stop here because of my desire for food, I continue to stop here because I have yet to find a friendlier Panera staff.  Every single time I get to the counter I am greeted with a smile and an excellent customer relations demeanor.

I also very much enjoy the food selection, and although I usually get the salads, I do have some favorites.

They Include:
Asiago Roast Beef Sandwich
Sourdough Breadbowls
French Onion Soup
New England Clam Chowder
BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad
Steak and Blue Cheese Salad

"You know, I'm surprised by how exceptional my experience was here!  

Firstly, they broke the rules and sat me before my party arrived.  I was a surprise, so this was really appreciated.  My friend was shocked to find me at their table!  

The server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu.  Now, he could have been a touch more relaxed for my taste, but overall, his service was great. 

The first bite into the warm pretzel loaf was just the beginning of this flavorful meal.  

The Mexican Drunken Shrimp are nestled into the best lil bite of guacamole.  The lettuce wraps are a customizable win for everyone.  The dipping sauces were tremendous.  Especially the cashew one.  

Entrees were trio of medallions, a surf & turf, and the short rib risotto. They were all very good.  Now, both of the potato sides were not as awesome as we had hoped, but that may be personal taste.  

So close to a five star experience.  Here's why it's not:  

The key lime pie dessert is a bit of a failure.  It tastes okay, but it's impossible to share.  That graham cracker sand is a choking risk.  Just make a crust.  

I emailed the restaurant previously as we were going to be surprising a friend for her birthday.  I inquired about sending a floral arrangement or something for the table.  I got no response.

"I walked in the market as soon as the doors opened and decided to view all the shops.  It's been a few years since my last visit and never been for breakfast.

As I walked past this shop called the Dutch Eating Place, I noticed a big crowd gathering around the bar seats and take out.  I walked the entire market and nothing caught my eye for breakfast so I quickly made my way back.  

Not knowing what to expect, I grabbed one of the last empty seats at the bar.  I was quickly greeted with friendly service and ordered the apple cinnamon french toast special with turkey bacon and orange juice for 7.99.

Oh man, when I took that first sip of the orange juice I was in heaven.  Best tasting orange juice ever!  The french toast were 3 good sizes with pieces of apple, lots of cinnamon on the top and a huge dollop of butter. The 3 strips of turkey bacon were thick and tasty, not greasy at all.  Even the patron to my left said ""That looks good.""  I agreed and dug in.

It wasn't until after I read the reviews here that I realized why my visit was so pleasant.  Next time (hopefully tomorrow morning) I'll also get one of the apple dumplings that looked great.

Tried it recently since it was sold and not that impressed.  Seems like they have lost some of the food quality and all the tables were dirty so obviously no one was paying attention to that.

It's always busy, because they make a great salad. You'll probably end up paying ~$10 for it, and that's fair. Almost all of their ingredients are local and fresh.

"WOWZA!! I am impressed!! 
OK, a little back story...Anyone who reads my reviews may have picked up on a few things, I love all different kinds of foods, and my fiancé is a real 'Meat and Potato"" kind of guy, therefore when he told me of this new ""amazing ethnic type food"" he had tried and couldn't stop talking about, I was rather excited...and curious... 
That was until he said the one thing I hoped he wouldn't...Thai food. 
Now don't get me wrong, I have tried Thai food on multiple occasions, in multiple different restaurants so it's not like I just brushed it off entirely...I literally have never found a Thai place I liked is all. Yet his enthusiasm was contagious and I aim to please, so off to Thai Lotus we went to order what he called, ""The best Pad Thai I've eaten since that one time I tried it in Sacramento!"" I find it adorable when he gets that excited about discovering new foods because usually I am the one excited, trying to drag him somewhere new! 
I ordered the combination Pad Thai at spicy level 3 and he the chicken at spicy level 4. I went to the bathroom for a very short time and by the time I returned the food had already appeared, taking no time to get to us at all! 
I stared at it for a moment...hesitant to try it...stalling by taking picture after picture with the defense of ""having to get the best shot for my Yelp review!"" that I would write later on...Finally the stalling could no longer be justified...I squeezed on the lime... sprinkled on all the peanuts they provided, took my fork right into the middle and with no turning back...I took the biggest bite I could figuring I was going all in or not at all!
My mind was changed instantly...the very moment the noodles, shrimp and peanuts touched my mouth I was in heaven! He looked at me expectantly waiting for some sort of sign that I liked it...a sigh of happiness told him I did! We sat in silence for a minute as I shoveled down another huge bite...
""I need more limes!"" I said ...""I already ordered some"" he said with a smile. Finally, something on food we agree on! We will be back, and I want to try other things too! ...

"After trying the French 75 at Luke's and immensely enjoying it, we decided we need to stop by the OG institution that served up this New Orleans classic. Walking into the bar you are transported back to the 1940s. The decor and ambiance is awesome although there's quite a bit of undesired cigarette and cigar smoke in the cozy bar area for non-smokers such as ourselves.

We are from California and went to Mannings after the Giants vs. Saints game. The restaurant was very busy when we arrived. The menu was basic bar food and they told us it would be 2 hours at least. The bar staff were very slow and under staffed. They had 1 game on and told us they didn't have NFL ticket ! Can't believe sporte bar didn't have multiple games on. It was a terrible experience and can't understand how Manning family couldn't provide better services. Very bad !

"We had heard that Jimmy Kelly's was a premiere steak house in the south. So we decided to try it for my wife's birthday.

The service was second to none, with out waiter being very affable and friendly. He was extremely helpful in recommendations and was a joy to have around.

We both had a Kansas City 18oz cut cooked Medium Rare. The steak was delicious and made to order. I had the steak fries, and my wife had a baked potato. They brought the potato toppings out separate which was nice, so she could load it however she wanted.

We had made online reservations, and had mentioned it was my wife's birthday, and they brought out a cake (free of charge!) with a candle on it. It made my wife's night. We even shared some with our waiter.

The ambience is great, as the restaurant is a converted mansion. The bathroom was a bit small and dark, and the stall didn't lock, and was extremely cramped.

The steak, as I mentioned was delicious, but I'm not sure it was worth the roughly $37.00 we paid for it. It seemed over priced for what you get.",2,1.0,4.40625,0.002319336,4.875,0.671875,4.9375,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.9453125,0.033203125,3.546875,9.5460564e-08,3.5

"Highly upset with my experience. Firstly, when we walked in there was no hello just immediately asked how many. Then when sat at the table no actual server ever greeted us. We were never talked to the whole time we were there and the only time we were was when ordering food. Our water glasses were also never refilled. Then when I get my sushi I ordered a Philly roll and it was just so salty and it didn't taste so well. So when I told a server walking around (because we never knew who ours was) he took away the plate and brought it to the manager. The manager proceeds to take the plate firstly to the wrong table asking them what was wrong with the sushi then realizes that it was the wrong table. Then when he comes up to me he shows me the roll sitting on the plate and asked what was wrong with it. When I told him it was too salty he started making excuses like I was stupid or something. The manager didn't even do anything about this except make excuses and roll his eyes at me which was so not professional.

"This review is only based on their ""Soon to be Famous"" house style wings! I have not tried anything else yet on the menu.

Can I just say that the house style wings was one of the BEST tasting wings I ever had and In my opinion it is the BEST in WESLEY CHAPEL. 

They are grilled not fried so it's not greasy at all. They were marinated overnight so they are very flavorful. Delicious!!! When you can eat the wings without needing any ranch or blue cheese, I call that a WINNER! 

SN: it is more expensive that other wing related restaurants in the area if you compare prices but it's sooooo good!

Other than that, it's located in a ice skating arena. It's not uncomfortably cold in the restaurant. It's a bar type, casual atmosphere and it's overlooking one of the ice rinks in the arena.",2,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.1875,1.0,4.96875,1.330136e-11,3.6875,1.0,2.34375,0.62109375,5.0,7.741619e-09,2.84375

Last night, we were WOWED by our entrees. So much so, that I actually asked the waitress if there was a new chef in the kitchen. I had never asked that question before, but every dish was beautifully prepared to perfection. Truly amazing. 

The waitress said, ""Yes, he started last week.""

"I attended a wedding here in their Silos room in Jan 2018. It was a easy location to find which was nice since we were travelling from over an hr away. There was plenty of signage to show you where to go and lots of parking. 

The wedding ceremony in the Silos was very nice and the room was dimly lit and felt very romantic. Everything was available in one central area so guest didn't need to wander around. 

The wedding had a photo booth and a dessert table in each of the silos. If someone didn't tell me to look up, I would've probably missed it. It was pretty neat looking up into a silo. 

I would say that the bathrooms were large but in a weird layout and it was difficult to walk past people washing their hands when you went to find an open stall.

My only complaint was that they were kinda rude. I'm gluten free, and simply asked if they had any gf options...and then got a brusque and rude-ish response, about how some foods are naturally gluten free (thanks for the update) and that they have GF bread, but that not all sandwiches can be made using that bread (apparently they pre-make all of their panninis--which is interesting to know they aren't made to order). So,  that's fine if you don't have any special menu items, and YES i'm aware that a kale salad doesn't have gluten in it, but no need to snap!

The crab cakes were overwhelmed with smoke and the mushrooms for the fondue were crispy and delish but the fondue seemed to be blue cheese dressing...with heavily smoked bacon and scallions and MayTag blue cheese. Steaks all around and they were super tender BUT again were over smoked...you could not clear your palate of the smoke. Service was okay...twice we had to ask for another wine and twice for another steak knife. They ran out of creamed spinach at 8:30 PM and it was unclear why they could not make more since they were still seating people at 10 PM.. Au Gratin potatoes were good as were the mushrooms/onions. Best part for me was the wedge salad and $7 was a reasonable price. Would I return...due to the pervasive smokiness of the food I would not but it was worth a try.,0,1.0,2.796875,3.6743586e-10,3.90625,0.00030899048,3.4375,1.0,2.921875,1.0,5.0,0.28710938,3.4375,0.25,2.875

The hostesses weren't the best, but the wait staff were extremely curteous and welcoming. Our server got one of our sides wrong, but we actually liked the mistake better than what we had ordered.

The food was mostly excellent with a tiny dash of meh. Hands down the best part was the hot sourdough rolls they brought out to start. Soooo amazing. The fresh swordfish was fantastic, as were the sweet potato fries and mashed potato cake (the mistake I mentioned--we had both order fries and one of us got mash instead. It turned out to be some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever tasted). The pineapple cole slaw was pretty delicious and refreshing, but the corn salad and the mango salsa that came with the swordfish were ever so slightly lacking.

"I've gone here many times...sometimes for dinner and sometimes just to meet up with a friend at the bar.  This place has been around for a very long time and it shows.  Even though they recently re-did a bit of renovating on the exterior of the building - it's still not quite enough.

The interior has not changed - ever.  Same pictures, same set up, same tables that get in the way of the bar area (there is really no room at the bar unless you are seated).  Don't eat too much here or you won't be able to fit in the restrooms...they are so small.  One for the men.  One for the women. Always a wait.  Not well-kept and a little messy all around.

They have a very extensive menu and their food is slightly above average, and they have always been consistent.  I like their appetizers better than their entrees. Their guac dip is definitely authentic and very fresh.  It's a great place to go for apps and drinks.  The outside is great in warm weather.   Inside it's usually loud, noisy and chaotic.   

I love margaritas but they have never really mastered them here even if you request top shelf  it just doesn't have the taste that it should which is disappointing for a mexican restaurant.

"Horrible!!  

Came here when a bunch of us were trying to leave town and drove by this ""Viet Pho"" place.  We decided to give this place a shot since it has a big sign in front that read ""Reno's Best Pho"".  NOT!!

Walked into the place and it looked like a cafeteria with it sharing a dining room with a sandwich shop.  We were greeted, seated, and presented with menus.  Then the funny thing was that we had to go to the counter to order and pay first...?!?  Why even seat us down and give us menus in the first place??

O wells...ordered my usual Pho Tai w/ beef on the side as my other friends ordered other pho combos.  When the pho came...my pho broth was really salty...like unbearable saltiness.  Tried my all my other friend's pho broth and EVERY one's broth was different!!  WOW!  It's funny because I started to wonder how they made their broth??  The beef was not fresh at all...just like rubber.  The noodles seemed very starchy for some reason as well.  Bad, bad, bad...

"The boyfriend and I usually frequent Donut Queen during our trips to Tucson but last Saturday as we joyfully drove to get some donut goodness we arrived at Donut Queen only to realize it was closed for the afternoon. But our salivating mouths would only be disappointed for a few minutes as we headed over to Donut King only a few miles away. 

Even though it was 2:00pm they still had a pretty wide variety of donuts to choose from. Nothing fancy or tricky about these donuts - your standard sugary fare - raised glazed, jelly filled, old-fashioned and cake donuts are available for your pleasure. 

The location is nothing fancy either. There are some booths there so you could sit and enjoy your donuts on the spot but it's really more of a take 'em home kinda joint.

I chose a glazed twist and a chocolate cake. The boyfriend went for the filled, a creme filled and a jelly. He thought they weren't quite as good as Donut Queen but I was happy with my twist. It was nice and soft with just the right amount of glaze. I ended up eating my cake donut the next morning and even though it was day-old it was still good.

The employees were wrapping up the food when we approached so I felt bad knowing they were getting ready to close up, but they were welcoming and assured us that we were okay to order. 

The woman who made our salads was very friendly. The salad was delicious. No roll came with the meal - not that I get one anyway - even though it was offered at the old location. In addition to our salads, we got small muscle builder smoothies (banana, strawberry, peanut butter). The woman making these asked if we wanted protein or energy for our boost. The way she asked this made it sound like the boost came with the smoothie. What we found out after was that this boost was ~$1.35 extra. This is where the biggest pitfall of this place comes into play: the salad and small smoothie came out to almost $17. I told my friend I enjoy the food here, but not enough to pay almost $20 for a meal that I could make at home twice the size for half the price.

The salmon, tilapia, ribs and chicken were very well cooked though and really tasty.
The cornbread was ok...not as good as I was lead to believe.

Just had a fantastic salad and a yummy grilled cheese... have been to Miles Table a couple times so far... I can't say enough good things about this place! We will be moving to NJ soon, and I'm sad because I finally found an amazing place in the neighborhood (fantastic food AND equally great service and staff) and we won't be living nearby much longer... but, I guess I'll use that as a good excuse for me to stop by for lunch and dinner as many times as possible before we move ;-)

"All the stars seemed to align the night I met one of my favorite fellow Yelpers, Ana T., a few weeks ago on the cozy patio for dinner. With downtown ""high""rises soaring overhead, this intimate space was perfecto for an al fresco chat and salad. 

Okay, I may have hesitated for a beat before committing to the Kale Salad. But. What a divine melange of chopped kale, goat cheese, persimmon, butternut squash, walnuts and red wine vinaigrette! 

We were so into our conversation, we barely registered that our cocktails arrived late. But the staff of 47 Scott wasn't going to let it slide. First came a most sincere apology from our server. Then, the manager comped our drinks! That kind of attentiveness and integrity is hard to come by these days.  Bravo!

Ana T. is lucky enough to live in the 'hood  -- and I'm jealous of that. Used to live in SanFran and loved walking everywhere!  But coming from the far east side of Tucson this time, the narrow alley-like blip of Scott felt like a most welcome slice of Europe (okay, use your imagination) a la Tucson.

I searched on yelp for a boba place and a few came up but this one had something different. Vibe seemed different and had a variety of tea selection so I gave them a try! All I have to say that I'm glad I did. The place has a variety of things. A lot of students for sure, they have a quite room for students to study which is nice. They can sit on the floor with the cushion they provided for comfort and I thought that was amazing. Their customer service is beyond outstanding, upon entering there I was greeted and welcomed and introduced to the different kinds of teas they have and from there I ordered and found to table to sit, you can even join other tables which is nice too. I ordered the peach apricot black tea which was just perfect. I asked if it was gonna be too dark or anything and they said they can modify anything I want and add sweetener or not as sweeter. So they're very flexible. Their food was also really delicious and fairly priced. I had their noodles and they were absolutely amazing with tofu. Very tasty.

"Sabrina's is great.

Here's why:
1. Sabrina is the cook and the owner. That means she creates her own dishes.
2. Sabrina cooks with experience. I had a pulled pork sandwich, while my girlfriend had a noodle salad. Being of these were much better than I was expecting. Why? Because Sabrina had put effort in making them taste better.
3. Sabrina serves healthier food in a location that has little. I had looked around for a reasonable restaurant in Reno before serendipitously settling on Sabrina's. I was looking for something that wasn't burgers, wasn't a diner, and wasn't a buffet. Sabrina's was the best choice.
4. Sabrina listens. Since we were the only customers, she came out of the kitchen and chatted with us because why not? We were able to give her feedback about the food, and what we liked about it, and she told us about why she made it that way.

It's not often that you can walk into a restaurant off the street while passing through a city, and come back with a great experience.

"I had been in search of an Ethiopian joint after moving to Reno from Northern California.

When I walked in I was the only one there, her hours are a little funny as the owner is recalibrating.
A simple design with ample room and welcoming sights and smells she told me to sit where I pleased. I ordered the Vegetarian platter and waited excitedly with great expectations...

"It was such a dive bar, it was basically a dive bar that happens to have food. The place was rowdy, casual, really dark and pretty cramped but it was a fun experience.

The food:

Fried Seafood Platter- Fried redfish, shrimp, oysters, crawfish, crab claws served with french fries and slaw. I am not the type of person to get fried seafood since it takes away from the seafood flavor but holy shit was this awesome. First, the dish was humongous, it easily feeds 4 people, second, everything was perfectly fried, everything from the shrimp to the oysters to the crab claws were all delish, I highly recommend this. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=B5NkKdB_MWB8JYwBdaLTtA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Blackend Redfish - 8oz filet seasoned in a Bayou Blend and grilled served over rice with Creole Green Beans in bacon sauce. I thought the flavor of the fish was good but I felt the fish came off too firm, the texture of the fish kinda threw me off. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ljMoVbU5jRT22S234yOWAA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA

Jambalaya Supreme- Simmered with tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, local seasonings, boneless rabbit, chicken and smoked pork sausage with shrimp and tasso added. I thought this was just OK, I didn't love the flavor nor the texture, I also didn't think the $5 upgrade for the supreme was worth it, either. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=OKWvLSXpKNGrwjLcvLcAqA&userid=Y_iTTjKvV5hLy-880SZzlA",2,0.00048828125,4.4375,0.0003414154,4.375,0.0023498535,3.921875,0.000667572,4.375,0.0005302429,4.34375,0.0007362366,4.40625,0.0005226135,4.40625
"The quest to find the best fried noodles in Edmonton continues, this day I was at Good Buddy South for lunch.  Having been to Good Buddy North, I have certain expectations, Good Buddy South is quite different from its northern sister restaurant; there is no big screen TV, there is no updated decors, there is no dim sum, there is no modern lightings.  Its décor is dark and dated, dim sum carts are no where to be seen, the place looked like a traditional noodle joint and is in need of an update.  

When I first walked in, the one thing the surprised me is how dark the restaurant is.  It took my eyes a minute or two to adjust to the dim environment when coming in from the daylight.  The restaurant was very busy, it was completely full but they managed to squeeze me in somehow. 

The ladies ran around with plates of food (frequently delivering to the wrong table) but food were coming out of the kitchen supremely fast; they have one efficient kitchen.  

I ordered the Beef Brisket Lo Mein and the Dry Fried Chicken Hor Fun.  If you look at the picture, you would notice that one thing is distinctly missing from the Lo Mein...  WHERE IS THE SAUCE?  The brisket was as dry as dry can be, the flavour just wasn't there; without the complimentary soup, it would not have been edible.  I would not order it again.  

The Hor Fun on the other hand came fresh and hot.  I knew I wasn't going to be able to eat both dishes so I had it in to takeout box, the box was beyond full, they were not able to close it.  The fried noodle portions here are gigantic.  How did the hor fun taste?  A disappointingly ""below average"".  It wasn't bad like the lo mein but it wouldn't be up there with the better noodle joints in town.  It was missing some of the traditional ""wok hei"", that smoky fried noodle smell.  You can tell that the chef was in a hurry as among the darker soya sauce laced noodles are clumps of pure white noodles, the chef did not take the time to mix the noodles well.  The chef just didn't take the time to make that perfect plate of noodles.  As Emeril Lagasse said: ""you have to season both sides, nobody likes one sided flavoured foods"".

Value wise, this restaurant produces great value.  Both plates of noodles add up to $20 and it was enough for me as lunch/dinner plus a light breakfast the next day.  Leftover hor fun makes fantastic breakfasts, if you don't believe me, try it yourself.  I believe that the place is busy because of the tremendous value it provides its patrons.  

A bit of a warning, the entire restaurant has a single one-person restroom for each sex.  When I was there a gentleman locked himself in for a full twenty minutes, as time progress, you can tell that the male population in the room became increasingly agitated.  When he came out, half the male population in the room dashed for the bathroom.  For a restaurant which seats about 100, a single one-person bathroom is grossly inadequate.  Also, the bathroom needed cleaning badly...

Would I return for noodles, probably not, there are better noodle joints near by.  I would come for dinner one night to check out the non-noodle dishes, may be I would have better luck with those dishes.",0,0.0099487305,3.5,0.024414062,3.28125,0.75,2.40625,0.04711914,3.171875,0.046142578,3.34375,0.016235352,3.40625,0.032470703,3.3125

"Warmest welcome to the neighborhood!

I'm thrilled and here's why: 

As someone who works from home, I know my coffee shops (I tend to camp out for a bit). Provider is located on the main level of Tinker House (event space on the second floor. It hits all the basic requisites for being a great spot to work from (plugs under the tables, comfy seats, a community bar-like table to spread out on, friendly staff and a great coffee menu and fresh croissants).

Beyond this, Provider also inspires creativity with their gorgeous decor: cute neon sign with a positive message, great plants and cool tile work. At the same time, the kind, welcoming staff are also crafting amazing lattes. I had a Pistachio Latte with cashew milk (never tried it before so why not?!). It was delicious and I'm not even usually a coffee drinker. 

The best part? THERE'S A GARAGE DOOR THAT OPENS TO THE OUTSIDE. I often have phone calls in the middle of working, so it was incredible to walk outside for a call and have that quiet while also being able to watch my stuff.

"Ooh wee! Dirty Dishes was just added to my list of favorite food trucks about 30 minutes ago when I devoured one of their plates inside of Canal Place! I found out about Food Truck Fridays in front of Canal Place not long ago via Instagram and this Friday, I saw that Dirty Dishes would be there. Since I had yet to try them, I figured why not!

It was more of a brunchy lunchy fest so I was a total fan. I can eat breakfast any time of day. There were a few of their well-known specialties on the menu such as the dirty mac and cheese and BBQ shrimp and grits, but I wanted to try something a little sweeter.

I originally wanted the Praline Chicken and Waffle Sandwich but they were all out! My next choice were the Hot Sausage Stuffed Waffles, which I am SO glad I chose. These were huge, soft Belgian waffles with crispy outsides and warm, spicy hot sausage-filled insides. A TOTAL flavor punch. The praline glaze was much like a light syrup that was just the right amount of sweet. The powdered sugar touch was a nice addition.

"I was looking for the best and cheapest wine tour for a weekend so I searched Captain Jack's. They offer either a wine or beer tour for $50. They had great reviews so I decided to book it. We had a wonderful guide and were driven around in a large SUV with 3 other couples. We did the beer tour and stopped at 3 different ""bars"". Only one was a brewery and the rest were bars. The fee paid for each tasting and we also stopped for lunch. The only down side is make sure you check with the driver about what tour you're on. We mistakenly got into the wrong car but checked before we could take off but on our tour we picked up the wrong couple. They don't give their drivers names of the people to pick up, only a location (which is at your hotel if you're staying in Santa Barbara).

"It was hard to express how many stars I would rate my experience here. Due to highs and lows of my experience.

First off, the service was great! Props to my server Ashley. He was attentive and very nice. The food came out fast.

To start off, my sister and I got the dozen charbroiled oysters. I heard so much about them from other people and friends that they were a must have. It was the biggest letdown. They were a bit below average. It had a bitterness to them. 

For the entrees, I got a lobster empire and my sister the Drago's mixed grill. The lobsters were over done and the lobster empire is said to have a creamy rich sauce. Instead it was more on a savory spice side. 
The steak for the mixed grill was great! Nice cook on the meat. 

All in all, the food just made the whole experience disappointing. Hopefully if you come here you eat your food fast because it came out warm and chilled really quick. For spending almost 100 dollars, it didn't taste like that for sure.
I would recommend trying out Acme for the oysters and even Red Lobster had better cooked lobsters.",0,1.0,1.9921875,1.9984014e-13,4.46875,1.2218952e-06,3.078125,1.0,5.0,0.9765625,1.9765625,0.67578125,2.28125,0.9765625,4.96875
"I came here for restaurant week and I was also celebrating my anniversary with the Mr.! This is the perfect place for a date or more romantic dinner! Especially since it is tapas style and you can share plates/try different things. Friends and groups are definitely welcomed, but the ambience with candlelight lighting (and wine bottle selection!) have total date vibes for trying to impress someone.

Restaurant week First Course: We ordered Serrano ham, manchego cheese, olives, and the paprika garlic chorizo! Wow, the chorizo was flavorful and seasoned perfectly. All items complimented each other. The first course is served with a little bread too

Second course: We orders the duck montadito, Pulpo (octopus!), the green beans, and beef brochettes. The beef brochettes were tender beef skewers, and octopus was on point in their thick marinade. The winners for the course was surprisingly the duck! I don't believe this is a regular menu item but if you get the chance, definitely order it!! It was incredibly rich and served on a small piece of baguette with a sweetened cherry. All the flavors complimented each other and reminded me how delicious duck can be when done right! Last, the green beans may be the best green beans I ever had. They were served with almonds, in a balsamic vinaigrette-oil with additional seasoning that were absolutely delicious. You know if they make green beans as it's own dish, then they have to be pretty incredible. 

Dessert: goat cheese flan and an ice cream yogurt fruit dish! Absolutely delicious, light and sweet. We were also served two sweeten pears at the end of the meal as a last goodbye treat.

Overall the food was incredible! Service was really quick, if I had to give one negative it is the size of the tables. Especially with tapas, there were a lot of plates and little space. Everything else was stellar.

When making the reservation, I noted it was for an anniversary dinner... to my grateful surprise the restaurant gave us complimentary champagne for the celebration! It was greatly appreciated and thoughtful. Restaurants that go that extra step is why this place deserves the five stars!",2,0.11328125,3.3125,0.114746094,3.28125,0.11669922,3.328125,0.119140625,3.265625,0.14160156,3.296875,0.123535156,3.3125,0.09375,3.3125
"I wanted to love this place and had very high expectations (which was probably part of the problem). The tacos have tons of meat filling, which most people will love. They certainly do not skimp on meat (and the meat has good flavor) and they are very well-priced. My issue is more that I prefer flour tortillas, so I asked if they did those instead of corn and I was told no. However, I was with a bunch of people and several of their tacos came out on flour tortillas. I guess certain tacos are served with flour, but they are not very willing to switch it up? Didn't make me feel all warm and fuzzy. I got the chorizo and carnitas tacos and both were good, but just didn't have any depth of flavor. I will admit that I am very particular about my Mexican food and prefer a specific style, but these just didn't wow me. Since they were so full, I could barely close them to eat them, so ended up using a fork, which is no fun. My friend ordered a burrito and it was so huge she had to set it in the palm of her hand and try to navigate it with the other hand. She could barely eat it and quickly gave up. One huge plus is the salsa bar, which I always appreciate!

As for the ice cream, they make you uncomfortable asking to try more than 2 (out of the probably 50+ very unique flavors there) because they have signs in multiple places stating that you can only try 2. I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. I can go to Clementines or Jeni's and try anything I want with no judgement. It's hard to say what you'll even like with that much selection and only 2 tastes.

Overall, I just wasn't impressed with the service or food. However the salsa bar is legit and the price is right.",1,0.97265625,3.234375,0.97265625,3.234375,0.0010299683,3.5625,0.96875,3.25,0.96484375,3.265625,0.97265625,3.25,0.96875,3.25

The stores is set up with a nice overall feel to it. (The parking is a little iffy...but, I'll let that slide.) There's a bakery, gelato and dessert bar, a very large meat and seafood counter and a good-sized produce area. They offer over 20 different kinds of coffee beans, even Peet's Coffee!

"An adorable, coffee shop/bakery with a mix of artwork, rustic tables and bar top, and friendly staff.

The macchiato is a true macchiato (espresso with a dollop of cream), which the staff kindly pointed out and inquired if I wanted a ""Starbucks-style"" macchiato with milk (whole, soy, or almond) and a drizzle of caramel. The result was a far better caramel macchiato than Starbucks produces--likely better beans, and not overly sweet.

An assortment of muffins, scones, cupcakes, cookies, and bars tempted. I chose a banana walnut muffin with some trepidation, as often non-homemade muffins are sickly sweet. I was pleasantly surprised to bite into a moist muffin (don't!) that tasted much like my own banana bread (i.e., just the right amount of sweetness).

The clientele seems varied: fathers with their under-10 kids, couples designing wedding cakes, families getting hiking treats, teens picking up cupcake orders for graduation parties, etc. This shop definitely seems to be a neighborhood gathering space.

"I came to New Orleans for a quick day trip and a friend recommended Mother's, so I decided to stop in.

When I walked inside, I was greeted and asked to write down my name and number on a notepad (for contact tracing). Then I was asked if I was dining in and when I said, ""Yes,"" I was seated at a table and told my server Ms. Pat would be with me shortly.

Ms. Pat came to the table and I definitely would've thought she was one of my aunties. She had the sweetest, most motherly demeanor. She recommended some things and took my order. I went with a cup of the filé gumbo and a catfish po' boy. It took a minute for my food to come up and when Ms. Pat saw that it hadn't arrived she went back to check on it and came right on out with it.

The gumbo was GOOD! I should've ordered a bowl instead of just the cup. The po' boy was a little disappointing. I liked the bread and how well the catfish was fried; however, it was super bland. I looked up on the counter and noticed sweet potato pie, so I decided to order a slice. It was cool.

We had the mozzarella-stuffed meatballs as an appetizer, followed by the Santa Fe Caesar salad. For dinner we had the boneless beef short ribs over mashed potatoes and gravy.

We spent the day on the sand and at the bar. We listened to amazing live music throughout the day. It was a great experience. We payed on the sNd and swam in the gulf.

"4 stars for the food (that's all i'll say here; it was a good high-end steakhouse food). 2 stars for the service. We came with a party of 8; the waiter came up to us and nonchalantly took 5 out of the 8 diners' drink orders and completely neglected the rest of us. One of the bus boys spilled ice water all over one of the in-laws. She was very nice and apologetic, and we did not make a fuss about it. The hostess came with a few napkins to wipe the seat up, but the floor remained wet for the rest of dinner. No drinks were comped. The waiter's indifferent attitude did not change throughout the entire dinner; there was very little attention paid to refilling non-alcoholic beverages. 

I expect a lot more for a large top at a nice restaurant like this. This is actually the second time I've been here, and the service was significantly better the first time around.

I also like the atmosphere.  Down to earth and unpretentious.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a beautiful restaurant, but there's a certain pretentiousness that sometimes get associated with healthy food... none of that here.  The prices are also reasonable.

My only concern is that the food is served on plastic plates with plastic silverware, creating a lot of pollution that will still be around for our grandchildren since it's not biodegradable.  One star off for that. Would love at least a $1 off option for bringing your own containers to encourage less generation of waste.

"Yelp Community, all y'all are awesome!  Fellow Yelper Dee M and I checked this place out after catching a movie at nearby South Street Cinema.  It's one of several restaurants on the south side of South Street, facing the Abbot Square apartment complex.  

The restaurant looks like you're sitting in a Tuscan villa, all warm tones, rustic touches.  We were greeted warmly and sat at a comfortable two top. Note: For those reviews that mention meatballs, they have had a complete menu change in the last 18 months they told us, focusing now on homemade pasta and gravies.  Mmmmmmmmm.

I see there's gnocchi on the menu. I am somewhat skeptical. Being from an Italian family, I have many happy memories of my Nanny's homemade gnocchi, and have never found anyone who gets close.  The staff assured me that theirs are home made, and they originate from a town in the same region as my family.  The chef comes out and we converse, he is jovial and engaging.  They bring me a small sample of the gnocchi.  It is definitely homemade, fresh and definitely delicious.  It's not my Nanny's gnocchi but that's OK because it's quality pasta. 

Dee orders the gnocchi and I opt for the lasagna bolognese.  Our chef assures me that he knows bolognese. Sweet Mother in Heaven he does, the bolognese is savory and rich and the lasagna noodles are thin and light and also home made.  Honestly some of the best lasagna I've had in ages, and so great that they understand the noodles shouldn't be thick slabs, but thin layers that support rather than overwhelm the fillings.

Service was very attentive, they are family run, we learned the family owns a few restaurants in the city and has been in business for many years.  It shows, they know what they are doing.  I can't wait to find another reason to head down to South Street and enjoy a meal there.",2,0.076660156,3.21875,0.08251953,3.296875,0.90234375,2.625,0.08496094,3.25,0.10498047,3.25,0.07861328,3.25,0.10498047,3.21875

"5 Star, 5 Star, 5 STAR!!!!!

If I could give an infinite number of stars to Candace and Neil I would! 

I first met Candace a couple years ago and I found her cakes to be absolutely delicious. I order a couple small cakes for my mom's and sister's birthdays. No big deal, they were incredible as well. 

Then when we decided to get married in August of this year (2014), my (now) wife wanted to look around. Candace was definitely on our list, but she wanted to do due diligence. I knew who I wanted. We met with a couple of very nice companies who did weddings. We wanted something different - we wanted cupcakes instead of a big wedding cake. We wanted one small cake to cut, and then cupcakes for everyone there! People were more than willing, and we had a week of yummy goodness. 

Then I took her to see Candace and Neil. BOOOOOOOOOMMMM!!!! Blown completely away, Not only were we blown away by Candace's scrumptious cupcakes, we were AMAZED at how she wanted to work with us and customize stuff for us. You see, we had a budget for everything and some of the others had packaged plans that we needed to fit into. Not with Candace - sure she had her packages, but when we told her our budget, she scrapped the package. She scrapped a number of ideas. 

This was an Indian wedding with 250 people. Here's what she came up with to be completely unique: 

Cupcakes with a solid flat piece on top. All of those solid pieces on top would be cut-outs from one design, which would be a custom Henna design, which she would cut up into squares to place on top of the cupcakes laid out in a pattern. WHOA!! Also, cake pops! Because not everyone wants a whole cupcake. Those were a hit - and they also had little designs on them. FINALLY - one giant cupcake, which would be the one that we were going to cut. 

My friends, Candace and Neil MADE that area of the room. It absolutely lit up, people flocked to it to see the design, as they had never seen anything like it before. 

And...oh my gosh...everything was DELICIOUSLY out of this WORLD! 

I thank you, Candace and Neil, for being such creative, amazing, warm, giving people. A business that I will definitely work with time and time again.",2,0.022216797,2.75,0.015075684,2.890625,0.84765625,2.296875,0.033447266,2.671875,0.01965332,2.8125,0.020385742,2.765625,0.024658203,2.765625

Trader Joe's sells cashews for $6.99 & pine nuts for $5.99 for an 8 oz package - which makes it $11.98 per lb. They actually lowered their price from last year.

Actual meals were large in size so we got to take a lot home and enjoyed them the next day.

"Visited this place on Valentine's Day weekend. It was absolutely packed, but it was worth the 30 minute wait! 

You'll literally find yourself sitting in the middle of a house, around a griddle, cooking your own food. The service was wonderful and the environment was amazing.

The only reason I give this a 4* instead of a 5* is because of the prices. I would err on the side of it being too expensive when you do the cooking yourself- although that's the whole point of going.",2,3.3527613e-07,3.71875,2.0605512e-08,4.25,0.91015625,5.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.03125,5.7980287e-11,2.515625,0.7578125,4.0625

The other meal was two eggs with grits and bacon. Grits and bacon up, eggs were over cooked, down.

"My husband and I went to Amis last night and sat at the kitchen bar. Our first time here and definitely not our last.  A great choice. Put your phone down and watch the orchestrated chaos- a great/fun kitchen to watch. The food they put out was incredibly flavorful, well seasoned and cooked to perfection. 
What we ate: Salmon crudo with fresh julienned beets (amazing-highly recommend)
Baked Pecorino with almond honey (very good, sweet, would have had as a dessert with tart apple slices)
Swordfish meatballs (go for it, trust me you'll love them, maybe even more than the traditional meatball)
Sams- traditional meatball ( a very good meatball- looking for a little more crispness to the outside)
Casarecce  with a light and spicy san marzano tomato sauce with salmon and toasted bread crumbs (a special that night and delish!)
Bucatini with jalapeno and almond pesto (perfect amount of heat)
Spring pea Tortelli with lamb ragu and mint

I got a delicious cocktail and my friend and I split the 5 option charcuterie board. We were able to choose 5 options of a list of cheese and meats.

"The food at the restaurant is delicious, fresh and made on site. But my review is aimed at their catering service.
We were hosting a dinner for 35 people for our son's rehearsal dinner in South Philly. He asked for Dim Sum. We investigated a few places, including our normal go-to (another spot in Chinatown). None had a dedicated catering process, and this was too important to leave to chance. We hadn't been to Dim Sum Garden in a few years, but thought we'd try it. We were overjoyed with the quality and taste, and more to our delight, it had a catering operation. We were also able to order regular menu items not on the catering menu.
On a Monday we ordered the food, and it was delivered the following Friday. The food was warm, fresh and delicious. The delivery was right on time, and the delivery person was very helpful in setting the food up for us. Everybody raved about it, and it made our special dinner an event to remember.
